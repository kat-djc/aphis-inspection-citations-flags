From correspondence on June 9th, 2021 referring to an\\nanimal welfare discussion between the AV, associate veterinarian, Facility Curator and Training Curator, the Attending\\nVeterinarian expressed concern for the dolphin’s poor appetite and requested a blood sample on this animal. The\\nassociate veterinarian stated her concern to the General Manager regarding the trainers’ repeated denial that Squirt was\\nill. She stated her concern for the trainers not appreciating or acknowledging the associate veterinarian’s concern for\\nSquirt on at least 6 occasions over 10 days. Per the medical record, Squirt’s base intake was decreased over a period of\\n10 days beginning May 15th, 2021. Once blood was finally obtained the 24th of May, the bloodwork was abnormal. The\\nveterinarians expressed concern that the construction and frequent lowering of the water could have adverse health\\neffects on animals in the Dolphin Harbor pool. The veterinarians recommended that pool repair, which required pneumatic\\nnail guns, be delayed in order to decrease stress to the animal. Both veterinarians recommended that Squirt be moved in\\nwith a female-only group and away from a male currently housed with her to reduce stress. However, the Facility Curator\\nand Training Curator stated that this was not possible, and repairs continued. Alternatively, both veterinarians\\nrecommended Squirt and an additional female be moved to a different pool away from the construction and male dolphin\\nto reduce stress on Squirt. The animal wasn’t moved into an all-female group until the 16th of June 2021.\\nToki, a 56-year-old whale, had been maintained on a fish diet of 160 pounds that was decreased to 130 pounds by the\\nTraining Curator, over the objection of the Attending Veterinarian. The veterinary concern was that Toki historically has\\nseasonal abnormalities in blood work and behavior and her alkaline phosphatase was quite low (indicative of overall\\nhealth and nutrition status). The AV was also concerned that Toki wasn’t getting enough water (as marine mammals\\nextract water from fish for their hydration needs) and that the lack of food volume would cause her distress and agitation.\\nThe AV also had concerns with the Training Curator dictating the incorporation of fast swims and big jumps into training\\nsessions and shows for this geriatric whale. Toki’s bloodwork was abnormal and the AV believed these behaviors could\\nresult in over-exertion and Toki becoming winded, which was actually observed by both the senior trainer and the AV.\\nThe AV also diagnosed that Toki had hit her lower jaw, likely at the lower flume/bulkhead during fast swims. Toki’s\\nmedical records indicate an injury to her lower mandible on February 25th, March 10th, March 31st, April 6th and 7th of\\n2021. In a medical entry written on April 3rd, 2021, the AV directed the staff to not request head in entry jumps from Toki.\\nThe Training Curator, who has been working at this facility for 6 months, disregarded the veterinary instructions for Toki to\\nrestart bow jumps only and re-instituted head in entry jumps including speed runs and multiple high energy jumps.\\nThe veterinarians did not approve of a planned move of two Pacific white sided dolphins into Toki’s pool and strongly\\ndisagreed the plan should proceed due to Toki being medically and behaviorally challenged. The attending veterinarian\\nand associate veterinarian expressed concerns regarding this move during an animal welfare meeting on June 7th, 2021.\\nThe Training Curator, General Manager, and Animal Care Curator were in attendance. Additionally, medical entries on\\nJune 7th, 2021 in Toki’s record document the AV’s concern regarding the lag move. Chasing, white water and aggression\\nbetween Lii and Catalina, two Pacific white sided dolphins, and Toki had been observed and was of concern as the two\\ndolphins being moved into the whale pool were a mom (38-year-old Loke) and 3-year old naïve calf (Elelo). In the\\npresence of the USDA inspectors, the GM, Facility Curator, Training Curator and Whale & Dolphin Harbor Supervisor, the\\nveterinarians expressed concern in opposition to this lag move. Despite the veterinarian’s objections, the plan was to\\nproceed the week of the USDA inspection but has since been postponed.\\nThe Attending Veterinarian disagreed with the Training Curator decreasing 38-year-old male Pacific white sided dolphin\\nLii’s dietary food intake from 15 pounds to 9 pounds. The AV was concerned that decreasing his food base lowered his\\nwater intake and negatively affected hydration status. This had the potential to negatively impact Lii’s health. After a\\ndiscussion, the AV agreed to decrease his base intake to 11 pounds as a compromise.\\nThe Facility Curator & Training Curator were communicating with a consulting veterinarian about changes to Toki's diet\\nwithout including the AV in the conversation. On March 11th, they contacted the consulting AV in order to justify the\\ncontinual decreases to Tokitae’s food base. Additionally, the Training Curator wanted to reduce her portion of salmon and\\nfeed Toki salmon chunks and guts. Medical entries on February 24th, March 30th & 31st, April 2nd, May 12th & 27th and\\nJune 2nd in Tokitae’s record document the AV’s notation that Toki’s base was too low. Documentation provided by the\\nfacility confirms a downward trend in Toki’s base beginning January 2021 of approximately 160.7lbs and continuing\\nthrough June 2021 to 132.1lbs despite the AV repeatedly voicing her concerns.

Two days later, the AV discovered that a consulting\\nveterinarian had been contacted without her knowledge and that he had agreed with Facility Curators that the bad capelin\\ncould be fed after soaking in cold water. After this realization, the AV had a verbal conversation with the Facility Curator to\\nstop feeding the capelin until a new lot could be acquired. The morning diets had already been fed that day.

       " '**On inspection, a one year old adult female cougar appeared to be severely underweight. The shapes of all\\nindividual vertebrae are showing. The outline of the entire lateral aspect of the hip and shoulder blade are visible.\\nThe thighs appeared to be sunken as often seen with muscle loss. The staff was aware of weight-loss, but did not\\ncontact a veterinarian.\\n**A three year old female white tiger appeared slightly underweight. The vertebral bodies were slightly showing and\\nthe hips appeared sunken in. The licensee reported he gave 20 pounds of chicken to this tiger in the afternoon. At\\ndirection from APHIS officials, the licensee gave an additional 10 pounds of raw chicken. The tiger quickly ate 7-8\\npounds and gradually finished the remaining chicken. A veterinarian was not contacted in regards to this animal(cid:25)s\\nweight loss.\\nWeight-loss can be a sign of multiple diseases or an improper diet. Under-weight animals do not have the adequate\\nenergy reserves for normal body functions and is highly stressful to the animal. On example, the immune system is\\noften severely hampered in times of stress and poor body condition. An animal with significant weight-loss at the\\nbeginning of winter is especially dangerous, because there is little to no reserves for the animal to keep itself warm\\nin the cold weather. Significant weight-loss can cause death or other serious medical conditions. At the first sign of\\nweight-loss, a veterinarian must be consulted and an appropriate treatment must be enacted to increase weight in\\nthe animal.\\n** The 18 year old Siberian tiger was observed moving very slowly and his hind quarters would sway unsteadily as\\nhe walked. Both of his hind legs appeared very stiff as he moved. His right hind leg appeared to be a little stiffer\\nand less functional than the left hind leg. He appeared to counteract the discomfort by adjusting his weight to his\\nother legs as he walked. This caused him to hold his body in an abnormal position. Given the observations and age\\nof the tiger, the licensee indicated he believe the animal had arthritis. The Licensee stated that he knew the animal\\nwas in pain. He stated that the animal had started showing these signs about two weeks ago and has steadily\\ngotten worse with the cold weather. Licensee made contact with the attending veterinarian by phone at the time of\\ninspection. After talking to the veterinarian, Licensee informed inspectors that the attending veterinarian had called\\nin a prescription to the local pharmacy for Meloxicam.\\nSerious signs of pain and discomfort need to be addressed as soon as they are identified. Although the Attending\\nVeterinarian has called in a prescription for this animal, it will still need to be seen by the attending veterinarian for\\nproper diagnosis.

       " '***The 18 year old white Siberian tiger identified as Niko was cited on 1/15/2014. Following that inspection the\\nlicensee contacted the attending veterinarian(cid:25)s associate by phone who prescribed 7.5mg of Meloxicam (an\\nanti-inflammatory medication) once a day for pain associated with presumptive arthritis. The animal has been on\\nthis medication for 14 days and was still displaying significant signs of pain and suffering at the time of inspection.\\nWhen initially approached Niko was laying down in the den box area. Both the licensee and inspectors\\nunsuccessfully attempted to coax the animal out of the shelter. Niko slowly and unsteadily attempted to stand\\nseveral times, however, with each attempt his hind legs were trembling and he quickly sat or lay back down. After\\nseveral attempts, Niko eventually was able to stand up; however, he would not move around or come out of the\\nshelter. The animal stood for a short period of time (less than 2 minutes) with hind legs trembling and then\\nappeared weak and unsteady when he was trying to lie back down. Later during the inspection Niko was observed\\nstanding and briefly walking out of his den box to urinate. During this limited movement, he continued to appear\\nunsteady and had a significantly abnormal gait which appeared tender / painful (worse than on the previous\\ninspection). The current treatment (oral Meloxicam) is not effectively treating this condition. The Licensee stated\\nthat the animal had no significant signs of improvement since the last inspection. He also stated that the animal\\nwas not feeling very well and was even worse on the colder days. Despite the worsening of this condition the\\nlicensee failed to contact the attending veterinarian or his associate to report that there was a continued decline of\\nthe animal(cid:25)s condition despite the prescribed treatment. According to the accuweather forecast, today had a high of\\n43 degrees and is expected continue to drop down to a low of 6 degrees by the beginning of next week. This\\nanimal is already exhibiting significant signs of pain and suffering. If the animal(cid:25)s condition is worsened with the\\ncold weather, the animal(cid:25)s pain and suffering will continue to increase as the temperatures decrease in the near\\nfuture.\\nFollowing identification of the worsening condition by APHIS Officials and instruction that the licensee needed to\\ncontact the Attending Veterinarian (AV) to communicate regarding the health of this animal and ongoing treatment\\nplan, the licensee did contact the AV. The attending veterinarian later confirmed that the Licensee notified him that\\nNiko was not improving shortly after the inspectors left the facility. The inspectors showed the attending veterinarian\\na video of the animal attempting to get up. He agreed that the animal is in pain and that Tramadol should likely be\\ngiven to alleviate some of the pain. He farther stated that Meloxicam should not be given for more than three days\\nbecause of the potential for causing kidney damage. The Attending Veterinarian later went to the property to\\nassess Niko and did prescribe Tramadol for pain relief.\\nWithout proper methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat serious health issues, animals can undergo\\nunnecessary health risks that can cause pain, suffering and the potential for death.\\nSerious signs of pain and suffering must be addressed with the attending veterinarian as soon as they are identified.\\nAdditionally, the Licensee must contact the Attending Veterinarian when a prescribed medication or treatment plan\\ndoes not appear to be effective or the condition worsens.\\n***An approximately six to seven year old male black leopard identified by the licensee as Backara appeared to be\\nsignificantly underweight at the time of inspection. Although this animal was lean at the last inspection, there\\nappears to have been significant weight loss in the past 2 weeks. The skeletal structure is now readily apparent\\nalong the topline. Individual vertebrae are easily visible even from a safe viewing distance and despite the winter\\nhair. Additionally, the pelvic structure and hips are also now readily apparent. Skeletal structure becomes more\\nprominent as fat and muscle tissue are lost during periods of starvation. The licensee stated that he has been\\nfeeding this animal 20 lbs of meat (chicken thighs) daily since the last inspection. Barring significant underlying\\nmedical problems, this appears inconsistent with the significant decline in weight seen in this animal.\\n***An eight year old male black leopard identified as Jumonji is now severely underweight. Although this animal\\nwas lean at the last inspection, there appears to have been significant weight loss in the past 2 weeks. The skeletal\\nstructure is now readily apparent along the topline, pelvis, and shoulder. Additionally this animal has developed\\nsignificant hair loss and open wounds in several locations including the legs, tail, and face. Individual vertebrae are\\nnow easily visible even from a safe viewing distance and the pelvic structure and hips are also readily apparent.\\nAdditionally the skeletal structure of the shoulder is also apparent. Skeletal structure becomes more prominent as\\nfat and muscle tissue are lost during periods of starvation. The licensee stated that he has been feeding this animal\\n20 lbs of meat (chicken thighs) daily since the last inspection. Barring significant underlying medical problems, this\\nappears inconsistent with the significant decline in weight seen in this animal. In addition to the significant loss of\\nbody condition, since the previous inspection Jumonji has developed several areas of hair loss on its front legs, hind\\nquarter, rear hock, face, tail and the back of the neck. The right front leg has an area of hair loss extending from the\\ntoes half way to the elbow. The skin is generally moist, bright pink and red in some areas. Additionally, there\\nseveral areas with red tinged discharge. The left front leg has an area of hair loss on outside aspect of paw and leg\\n(approx. 3 inches in length) with 1 inch long moist red lesion. The back right leg has an area of hair loss that is\\napproximately three inches and has an approximately 2 inch red lesion centrally. On the left hip area there is a 4-5\\ninch long area of hair loss. Both the upper and lower corner of the left eye has one inch area of hair loss. Finally,\\nthe last 3-4 inches of the tail has a large area of hair loss where the much of underlying skin appears to be missing.\\nThe tissue is moist red and raw in appearance and much of the discharge appears to be fresh and dried blood.\\nThe Licensee informed inspectors that this issue started about two days ago and that this animal has had this issue\\nseveral times in the past. He stated that he had not contacted the attending veterinarian and instead began\\ntreatment similar to what he had used previously. This treatment consists of feeding 1cc of Ivermectin daily\\n(injected into the meat source that will be fed to the animal). The licensee stated that this treatment has been\\nsuccessful in the past for resolving the issue within two weeks. The attending veterinarian later confirmed that a\\ncombination of Ivermectin and Prednisone has been a successful treatment for the hair loss and lesions in the past\\nand that these lesions typically appear during the winter months. He also confirmed that they have previously taken\\nskin scrapings with no conclusive results for diagnosis. After identification of this animal by APHIS Official, the\\nlicensee did contact the Attending Veterinarian who visited the property and prescribed Prednisone for the treatment\\nof the hair loss and wounds.\\n***The three year old female white tiger named Tamara that was cited on 1/15/2015 still appeared to be significantly\\nunderweight at today(cid:25)s inspection. Although there appeared to be minimal improvement, the vertebral bodies were\\nstill readily apparent and the pelvic structure is still readily apparent. The licensee reported that he has been giving\\nthe animal 20 pounds of chicken and or deer meat every day since the last inspection on 1/15/2015.\\nWhen otherwise healthy young adult and adult underweight / emaciated tigers are offered appropriate feed for\\nseveral weeks significant improvement in body condition is expected. The lack of significant weight gain with\\nrespect to Tamara therefore indicates either the animal is not receiving adequate feed or an underlying medical\\ncondition exists which is increasing caloric demands or preventing adequate utilization of food. Additionally, the\\nrapid weight loss of the two black leopards Jumonji and Backara is a significant indicator that intervention\\n(modifications to feeding, appropriate veterinary diagnosis, etc) is necessary. Weight loss, or failure to gain weight\\nas expected, are significant indicators that additional veterinary care is necessary for the diagnosis and treatment of\\nany underlying medical conditions and / or re-evaluation of the feeding plan. Prolonged hunger from chronic\\nmalnutrition and starvation are distressful to animals and results in unnecessary suffering. Correct by ensuring that\\neach of these animals are examined by a licensed veterinarian and that an individual treatment plan is made to\\naddress any necessary diagnostic testing and routine monitoring of weight (or body condition) recommended by the\\nveterinarian that is necessary to rule out underlying disease and monitor future changes in condition.

This female hamster was thin and lethargic and in addition to the live pups one\\nfreshly dead partially cannibalized hamster pup was also present in the enclosure. When examined, this hamster\\nhad a large amount of soft wet brown debris around her tail consistent with diarrhea.\\n~ Animal 2: One gray and white Syrian Hamster was housed in a group enclosure in the trailer, first rack, row 2,\\nbox 3. This animal had a right eye that was sunken, crusted with brown debris and was held partially shut when\\nidentified by the inspector.\\n~ Animal 3: One dark gray Syrian Hamster with white feet was housed in a group enclosure in the trailer, first\\nrack, row 6, box 7. This animal had a patch of hair loss on its back and nose. The area of hair loss on the back\\nwas approximately 1cm in diameter and the underlying skin appeared normal. The area on the nose was smaller\\nand underlying skin appeared crusty. When identified by the inspector, the licensee stated that the hair loss on the\\nnose was just from pushing against the feeder and on the back was likely scars from fighting previously.\\n~ Animal 4: One female grey and white Syrian hamster was housed with her litter (containing 5 live pups) in\\nRoom #17, rack #1, row #2, box #3. This hamster had a wet area with brown discoloration on the underside of the\\ntail and chin consistent with diarrhea and grooming of the area. In addition to the live animals, there were also two\\ndead hamster pups in this enclosure. One of these was fresh and partially cannibalized. The second was older and\\nconsisted only of dried fur and skin.\\n~ Animal 5: One male tan long-haired Syrian hamster was housed with a single other adult hamster in Room\\n#17, rack #3, row #3, box #19. This hamster had incomplete hair loss / thinning over the hind end of the body. The\\nunderlying skin was dry and had numerous scabs. The facility representative stated that this was likely bites from\\nthe other hamster and separated them when identified by APHIS Officials.\\n~ Animals 6-15: One brown female Syrian hamster was housed with her litter (containing 9 live pups) in Room\\n#17, rack #3, row #1, box #5. The adult hamster had a moderate amount of wet brown debris under the tail\\nconsistent with diarrhea. The hamster pups were all wet over the fur on the backs and had varying degrees of\\ndiarrhea on their hind end. In addition to the live animals there was also 1 dead pup in this enclosure.\\n~ Animals 16-22: Seven juvenile Gerbils were housed in room 5 of the \\'Main Building\\' in rack #16, row #4, box\\n#7. This included 3 brown, 1 white, 2 black, and 1 tan all of which had areas of dark red-brown scabs over their\\nback and/tails. The most severely affected was the white gerbil which had scabs extending from the back of the\\nneck down the back to the base of the tail as well as hair loss in those areas. The licensee stated that there\\nappeared to be some aggression in this enclosure and removed the one animal that had the least amount of scabs,\\npresumed to be the aggressor and separated the enclosure for observation.\\n~ Animal 23: One black Russian dwarf hamster was housed with 7 other hamsters in box 5 of the hallway near\\nroom 5 of the main building. This hamster had a large area of hair loss covering 1/4 to 1/3 of its head between the\\neyes and ears.

Measures need to be taken to provide appropriate veterinary care in a timely manner in order\\nto prevent the animal unnecessary pain and distress.\\n~ Animal 25: A black chinchilla was observed to have hair loss on its neck area. This hair loss extended full circle\\naround the entire neck. Hair loss can be a sign of a more serious health issue. This animal had not yet received\\nveterinary attention for this condition.\\n~ Animal 26: A grey chinchilla was observed with an abnormal reddening area around its eyes with areas of hair\\nloss. There was crusty discharge on both eyes and nose, and a cloudy discharge on the left eye. The eyes were\\nsunken in and the chinchilla was huddled in the enclosure and appeared depressed and lethargic. These signs are\\nindicators of a negative health issue and suggestive of systemic disease and animal discomfort. The animal had not\\nyet received veterinary care for this issue.\\n~ Animal 27: A white chinchilla was observed with hair loss between its ears on the back of its neck. The skin\\nunderneath was bright pink in color. Hair loss can be a sign of a more serious health issue. This animal had not yet\\nreceived veterinary attention for this condition.\\n~ Animal 28: A black chinchilla was observed with a cloudy \"hazy\" appearance in both eyes. This condition\\naffected the center of the eye in the middle of the cornea. There was a discharge noted in the left eye. This could\\nbe an indication of a serious underlying medical issue and can cause distress to the animal. The chinchilla had not\\nreceived vet care for this condition.\\n~ Animal 29: A black chinchilla was observed squinting with a discharge from both eyes. The animal was not\\nopening the eye fully, which may be an indication of discomfort or pain. The animal remained huddled in the corner\\nof the enclosure and seemed reluctant to move around compared to the normal movements of the healthy\\nchinchillas.

       " 'The licensee interfered with the inspection by failing to report the possession of a juvenile tiger. On inspection, the\\nlicensee was asked multiple times in various ways about the presence of a juvenile tiger on the property that\\nincluded, but were not limited to: (cid:28)\"Are there any young tigers on the premises?(cid:29)\"; \"(cid:28)Are there any other tigers on the\\npremises?(cid:29)\"; \"(cid:28)Have there been any new tigers brought to this facility in the last six months?\"(cid:29); and \"(cid:28)When was the\\nlast time a new tiger was brought to the facility?\"(cid:29). After each question the licensee replied that there were no other\\ntigers on the property and specifically no young or juvenile tigers. The licensee stated the last time young tigers\\nwere on her property was back in October. The licensee failed to identify possession of a female juvenile tiger\\nnamed \"Lilly\" also known as Obie. When visiting with the Attending Veterinarian (AV) of the licensee off site, he\\nconfirmed that his clinic treated an injured juvenile tiger on 12/2/2014 at the licensee(cid:25)s facility. Additionally, the AV\\nasked how the tiger was currently doing demonstrating that he was under the impression the juvenile tiger was still\\non the licensee(cid:25)s property recovering from surgery. In order to confirm the presence of this tiger, the APHIS\\ninspectors returned to the property of the licensee to attempt to locate and inspect this animal. When the\\ninformation concerning the tiger was brought to the attention of the licensee, she did confirm that the tiger known as\\n(cid:28)Lilly(cid:29) was recently returned to her possession from another licensed facility, had been injured after its return, was\\ntreated by the AV 12/2/14, and was still on the property. The licensee claimed that she had \"(cid:28)forgotten\"(cid:29) about this\\ntiger because it was housed in another enclosure on the property which was located away from where the other big\\ncats were housed, in order to minimize contamination and stress while the animal recovered from her injuries.\\nAPHIS officials were led by the licensee to a building called (cid:28)\"peacock house\"(cid:29) that was located near some aviaries\\nand away from the other large carnivores. Throughout the duration of the entire inspection, the licensee led\\ninspectors past this area multiple times. This (cid:28)\"peacock house(cid:29)\" contained one female juvenile tiger. The APHIS\\nofficials inspected the juvenile tiger and its enclosure. Additionally, during inspection the licensee was questioned\\nabout a specific enclosure that has an adult male lion on one side and two adult tigers on the other. Since the\\nspacing in the fence was large enough (4in x 4in) for the adults tigers to possibly injury an animal in the enclosure\\nnext to it, the licensee was asked if an animal or specifically a young tiger would ever be put into that specific\\nenclosure. She stated (cid:28)\"Never\"(cid:29). Later in the inspection, the licensee revealed Lilly, the female juvenile tiger\\ndescribed above, was put inside that enclosure though reportedly it was only for \"(cid:28)one hour\"(cid:29) while staff was\\ncleaning the primary enclosure. The licensee(cid:25)s failure to inform inspectors about the presence and location of this\\nanimal prevented its evaluation during the initial inspection process. Additionally, the most recent record of\\nacquisition for this tiger was not available at the time of inspection. The animal was only able to be inspected,\\nbecause its existence was confirmed by an outside source and only then did the licensee acknowledge its\\npresence. A licensee shall not interfere with any APHIS Official in the course of carrying out his or her duties.\\nAdditionally, each exhibitor shall make all facilities, property and animals available for inspection by APHIS Officials\\nas required by section 2.126(a)(4).

This includes:\\n* Takin male (10 years old) ID # 112003 was on exhibit Sept 5, 2022 in pasture D when staff observed he was 3-legged\\nlame. This animal was anesthetized the same day for examination by the Attending Veterinarian. Upon exam he was in\\ngood body condition but had a RF comminuted fracture of humerus. Due to extent of injuries, he was humanely\\neuthanized. Pathology reports confirmed the fracture of the distal humerus and cubital joint as well as extensive bruising\\nof the surrounding area. Medical records indicated that this Takin also had swelling of the left eye on Aug 4, 2022 which\\nwas suspected to be due to trauma (though a primary ocular cause was not able to be ruled out). Although this individual\\nwas described by the facility staff as the primary breeding male Takin for many years. Records indicate that as of August\\n2022 another male Takin was showing dominant behavior.\\n* Takin male (8 years old) ID # 114007 was on exhibit Nov 7, 2022 in pasture D when staff reported the animal appeared\\nlethargic and had lost body condition. Animal was anesthetized the same day for examination by the Attending\\nVeterinarian who found a deep puncture wound on left caudal abdomen and suspected septicemia. This Takin was\\neuthanized due to guarded prognosis and on necropsy the wound was further explored. On necropsy it was determined\\nthat this wound extended 20 cm in several directions and while it did not connect with the body cavity adhesions and scar\\ntissue indicated that it likely did previously. This same animal had an abscess of the left shoulder in November of 2020\\nthat is also consistent with prior fighting. This Takin was appropriately treated and recovered at that time.\\nCurrently the facility maintains a large herd of Takin which is composed of approximately 20 males to 25 females. This\\ngroup of animals is housed in an open pasture that is approximately 100 acres, is shared with other species, and has\\nvarying topographic features. Wild Takin originate from Asia where they inhabit rocky terrain, dense forest, and alpine\\nareas. They usually are found in large social groups with females and offspring making up 98% of the herd. Both males\\nand females have their own dominance hierarchy structure. Mature males enter a breeding period seasonally known as\\n\"rut\" in which males often fight for dominance and the ability to breed with females. Non-dominant adult males are\\ntypically not found living with breeding groups and tend to be more solitary. During rut, young mature males may\\nchallenge the dominant male fighting for access to breeding females but typically the loosing male will not remain with the\\nherd after such a challenge.\\nDuring the inspection facility staff described that they typically have one primary breeding male and a small number of\\nother males which may breed with fewer females. The facility currently maintains too many male Takin in the breeding\\nenclosure/pasture and continues to have animals injured as a result of the lack of separation. As of December 2022,\\nthere is no separate area (or bachelor group) of non-dominant male Takin. The number and concentration of mature male\\nanimals is likely leads to an increased number of challenges to the dominant breeding male(s) by other mature\\nsubordinate males that are housed within the same area. Additionally, this concentration of males also likely leads to\\nincreased sparring and conflict between subordinate males as well. Although sparring and fighting or access to breeding\\nfemales is a normal behavioral pattern in wild Takin, the traumatic injuries which lead to the deaths of these animals\\nindicate that the co-housed animals are causing injury and discomfort. Given the number of co-housed males, the\\ndominant male and his females also cannot easily move away from challengers and are left in a position to have to\\nconstantly fight challenging males during breeding season while also actively breeding females which can leave the\\ndominant male exhausted, causing discomfort and interfering with his health. Having this many intact breeding males in\\none group with the breeding females is currently interfering with the compatibility of the herd. The facility still does not\\nhave a plan in place to be able to separate the established dominant male Takin and females from subordinate males to\\nreduce these conflicts which are causing traumatic injuries to various animals.\\nFailure to ensure adequate separation of incompatible animals can result in behavioral stress, injuries, unnecessary\\nsuffering, and death. Correct by ensuring that all animals housed in the same primary enclosure are compatible and\\nensuring through daily observation that staff intervenes to ensure adequate separation when incompatibility arises.\\nThis inspection was conducted with the Director of Animal Management and Vice President.

The veterinarian assessed the animal\\nvisually and produced a differential diagnosis of Dandy-Walker syndrome. As of July 14, 2015 the veterinarian\\nscheduled for additional diagnostics to include blood-work and a MRI. The facility management was unable to\\nproduce records regarding the veterinary treatment plan for this animal. The records that were able to be produced\\nindicated the date of the initial visual assessment by the veterinarian, the differential diagnosis of Dandy Walker\\nsyndrome, and a plan for future diagnostics. Between the time when the facility first noted issues with the animal\\nand the date of the inspection, the veterinarian had not taken any diagnostic samples from the animal to support a\\ndiagnosis. Limited records were able to be produced regarding the care of the animals at Living Treasures Animal\\nPark. During the inspection on July 14, 2015 the juvenile lion was housed in the back holding area of the enclosure\\nand remained in a resting position refusing to rise after being prompted with food. The facility offered a video\\nrecording as a representation of the juvenile(cid:25)s movement. In this recording the animal appeared to be stiff on all four\\nlimbs and reluctant to move, even for short distances. On July 15, 2015 the juvenile was in the main enclosure with\\nhis mother, the animal remained in a laying position and there were no apparent signs of injury during our\\nobservation. The facility representatives indicated that the juvenile was still very stiff in his movements, but had\\nshowed interest in playing with his mother immediately after his release into the main enclosure. He had a\\nroughened hair coat that had a moderate amount of mud along his back and on all four legs consistent with the\\nanimal(cid:25)'s movement around or through the mud within the enclosure. The documented diet for this animal includes\\n7lbs. of mixed red meat and poultry and to be supplemented with Platinum Performance: Exotic Wellness and\\nPerformance Formula. During conversation with the facility management, they stated this animal refuses to eat the\\nbones within the meat fed. This current feeding program provides very little calcium and other nutrients for the\\ngrowing animal. Upon inspection of the supplement there was a white film on the surface and the supplement was\\nheavily caked providing clear evidence that the supplement was not being consistently used. After speaking with the\\nveterinarian regarding the care of this animal, her initial assessment of the inappropriate mentation was made on\\nMay 4, 2015. In the record for that date she suspected neurologic disease, she recommended deworming and\\nantihistamine therapy. She completed a second visual assessment on June 19, 2015, when she noted weight loss\\nand recommended tranquilization for a hands on physical exam and further diagnostics. On the second visual\\nassessment, the veterinarian'(cid:25)s differential diagnoses were Dandy-Walker syndrome, vestibular disease or\\nincomplete fusion of cervical vertebra. According to the attending veterinarian, a dietary cause was not explored\\nbecause the adults were receiving the same diet and showed no signs of illness. The failure to understand that\\nyoung, growing large carnivores may have additional nutritional needs show a clear lack of adequate training and\\nveterinary care. Metabolic Bone Disease is a common disease of young big cats. This disease stems from\\ninadequate levels of calcium in the diet. During early development the animal will need an increased level of\\ncalcium in the diet to allow for bone growth. At the time of the inspection there was no evidence that the diet has the\\nproper nutritive values to maintain the animal in good health. The deficiency of adequate nutrition may have caused\\nthis animal severe animal welfare concerns.

The largest areas were present along the\\ntopline of the left side just in front of the hip (approx. 3-4 x 1.5 inches) and right hip area (2 inches x 1 inch). The\\nunderlying skin is dry, flaky, and pigmented and the skin present in haired areas is similarly flaky. When the hair\\nwas parted and closely examined, numerous live lice were observed. Additionally, there were numerous nits (lice\\neggs) observed on hair shafts along the sides of the goat. This goat is housed with seven other goats. Several of\\nthese goats were also observed scratching, but did not appear to have obvious hair loss. The licensee stated that\\nhis wife had recently dewormed and applied topical treatment for lice to the goats in the petting zoo area, but that\\nshe had not treated the animals in this area. The wife of the licensee confirmed this and said that she was not\\naware of the hair loss in this goat.\\nLeft untreated, lice may result in worsening of the condition and unnecessary suffering. In addition, trauma done to\\nthe skin from excessive scratching may lead to the development of secondary skin infections. When skin disorders\\nare the result of a contagious cause (such as lice), they may be transmitted to other uninfected animals in the same\\nenclosure or enclosures nearby. Correct by ensuring this goat and all animals exhibiting skin abnormalities are\\nexamined by the attending veterinarian. The licensee must follow all recommendations made by the veterinarian\\nincluding those regarding diagnosis, treatment, prevention, control of this condition, and recheck examinations.\\nRecords of these findings, treatment, and future recommendations must be kept for evaluation by APHIS Officials.\\nThis was first identified by inspectors and reported to the licensee on March 11, 2015.\\n*** Direct: An adult female muntjac housed in the enclosure near the outdoor African crested porcupine was\\nobserved walking with an abnormal gait. This animal had excessively long front hooves that curled upward and\\nwere not touching the ground at the ends (commonly described as an elf shoe apearance). This animal was\\nobserved for an extended period of time and it appeared that she was overextending both front legs and that she\\nwas only partially weight bearing on her left front leg at a walk. The soft ground in this enclosure made\\nphotographing her feet difficult. When asked the licensee stated that he was unaware of any lame animals in this\\nenclosure, but that the gait was most likely a normal behavior. The wife of the licensee stated that she was unaware\\nof any muntjac exhibiting lameness. She also stated that they often go under the shed that is in their pasture and\\nthat they can be difficult to observe.\\nLameness is a significant indicator of pain and failure to provide appropriate methods to properly diagnose and treat\\nthe underlying cause in a timely manner may result in unnecessary pain and suffering. Correct by having this\\nanimal evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and following all recommendations including those regarding\\nexamination, diagnosis, treatment, hoof trimming and future recheck examinations as needed.

This\\nwas first identified by inspectors and reported to the licensee on March 10, 2015.\\n*** A female muntjac housed in a stall near the keeper barn had excessively long hooves. This animal has an\\nabnormal left front leg which curves outwards below the knee. The hooves were severely overgrown on all 4 legs.\\nBoth claws on the left front leg were so severely overgrown that the claws are crisscrossed. The inner claw curves\\nunder the outer claw such that the animal appears to be walking on the hoof wall of the inner claw. The claws on\\nthe right front foot are also overgrown (although to a lesser extent) such that the tips of the claws appear to be\\ncrossing. Additionally, both rear feet are long enough that the claws are similarly crisscrossing on each foot. The\\nlicensee previously stated that the abnormal leg was the result of an old injury that had healed poorly, which is why\\nthis animal is separated from the main herds. Neither the licensee nor his wife were aware of the overgrown\\nhooves and there was no documentation regarding the care or treatment of this condition.\\nExcessively long hooves can cause lameness, unnecessary stress and discomfort to the animal and can lead to the\\ndevelopment of additional medical problems such as foot rot. Animals with preexisting leg abnormalities (whether\\nfrom previous trauma or abnormal confirmation) often require increased routine hoof care to prevent the\\ndevelopment of hoof problems. Correct by having this animal examined by the attending veterinarian and following\\nall recommendations regarding appropriate treatment for this condition and any additional routine husbandry care\\nthat may be necessary. The licensee must maintain records of the diagnosis and recommendations for evaluation\\nby APHIS Officials.

The fur\\nwas noticeably wet on the left side of the face of the rabbit between its left eye and nose on both March 10, 2015\\nand March 11, 2015 during the inspection. The eye itself appeared normal and the rabbit did not appear to be\\nsquinting or otherwise painful. The licensee and the wife of the licensee were unaware of the condition and both\\nstated that the rabbit appeared fine when it was brought to their attention by inspectors. The watery discharge from\\nthe eye can be caused by numerous conditions such as an eye irritation, eye abnormality or even a tooth problem.\\nCorrect by having this animal evaluated by the attending veterinarian and following all recommendations including\\nthose regarding examination, diagnosis, treatment, and future recheck examinations as needed. Additionally, the\\nlicensee must maintain record of these recommendations for evaluation by APHIS Officials. This was first identified\\nby inspectors and reported to the licensee on March 10, 2015.\\n*** The female Mandrill housed with the adult male Mandrill that was listed on the January 6, 2015 inspection report\\nstill has hairloss over the top aspect of both forearms.

The dogs have varying degrees of irritation to their ears including\\nscabbing, dried blood and/or open bloody sores. These bites can be painful and could lead to more serious health\\nissues for the dogs. Some of the dogs were observed shaking their heads to get the flies off. The two American\\nEskimos noted below were rubbing against the cyclone fencing in an attempt to get them off of their ears. All of the\\ndogs noted below had flies actively biting their ears during the inspection.\\n***A female German Shepherd (microchip #029323117) had flies on both ears and approximately a quarter of the\\ntop surface of the left ear towards the tip was bloody and did not have fur.\\n***A male German Shepherd (microchip #029319868), a male German Shepherd (#0A01564058), a female\\nGerman Shepherd (#0A01394871) and a male American Eskimo (#0A01533038) all had flies actively biting the tips\\nof both ears.\\n***A female American Eskimo (microchip #7F7A242A15) had flies on both ears with blood present on the right ear.\\nFailure to prevent or treat injuries relating to fly bites directly impacts the comfort of the animals and increases the\\nrisk of more serious health issues from these pest bites.

The left rear foot is more severely\\naffected with the inside claw curling upwards off the ground in addition to twisting. Untreated overgrown hooves can\\ncause discomfort to the animals and can cause abnormal forces to be placed on the joints in the foot and limb\\ncausing additional medical problems.

On today's\\ninspection the gobex still walked with a slightly abnormal gait and still has long hooves. The hooves on both front\\nlegs were excessively long, to the point that they were curling causing the toes to rotate up and out and the heel to\\ndrop. The licensee stated the animal had been pregnant, so they had waited to trim the hooves. Failure to\\nappropriately maintain hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries. As part of\\nthe facility s programs of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate\\nhoof and nail care in a timely manner.\\n*** The right eye of adult male coati mundi appeared abnormal. On today's inspection, approximately half of the iris,\\nin the right eye, had a milky-white, thickened opaque area. Eye disease can be caused by a variety of problems\\nincluding infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing.\\nFurthermore, not having clear vision can cause discomfort affecting the health and well-being of the animal and has\\nthe potential for injury.\\n***The camel calf has an abnormal swelling on its left hind hock. The swelling and condition of this animal has not\\nchanged since the Jan-13-2016 inspection.

The overall condition of the animal has changed since the last inspection. The animal now has a dull\\nhair coat and appears to have lost weight. The animal was shaking her head and pawing at the injured eye\\nfrequently during the inspection. She appeared to be suffering, as she exhibited signs of extreme stress and\\ndiscomfort for the species.\\nThe animal manager stated she was eating normally, but could not describe what he considered to be normal or\\nany changes in diet or feeding. The animal manager stated to APHIS staff that the eye has gotten much worse\\nsince November and continues to deteriorate. He described the animal as continuing to become more aggressive\\nand that she has become dangerous to handle. He stated that the last time that any veterinarian has examined the\\nanimal was on November 18, 2016 when she came to the facility and administered injectable antibiotics and used a\\nneedle to inject “something” directly into the eye. He noticed that they eye was a little better after the veterinary\\ntreatment on November 18, 2016 and it initially reduced in size and appeared to heal. On that same date, the\\nveterinarian discussed a plan of treatment to include daily administration of BNP eye ointment and possibly stitching\\nthe eye shut to allow it to heal if treatment didn’t result in improvement.\\nAccording to the animal manager, he continued to apply eye ointment as directed for approximately 10 days.\\nThey noted on their logs on November 28, 2016 that the eye was back down to a normal size, mainly dark, with\\nmilky opacity in the center.

The animal manager stated that after watching the AV inject the eye during her visit\\non November 18, 2016 he decided that he would also try to “pop” the eye on his own, in an attempt to improve the\\noverall condition of the eye. He stated that on several occasions over the last few months he has confined the\\nanimal, popped the eye both manually with his fingers and also with a needle, and then applied Gentamicin\\nointment to the eye.

Swelling of limbs such as this can result from\\ntrauma, infection and a variety of medical problems and can be painful. The lack of appetite supports the likely\\npossibility of pain and can also be present with infection and other medical problems.\\n2. One female, black and white skunk has a significant swelling on the bottom of the right hind foot extending just\\nabove the toes. There is a firm swollen area on the bottom of the foot that is approximately 2cm x 3 cm and is warm\\nto the touch. The skin on the bottom of the foot has broken open exposing red tissue and a thick, yellow discharge.\\nProblems such as this can result from trauma, infection and other medical problems and can be significantly painful.\\n3. One female, light sable ferret is observed squinting her right eye. There is a clear discharge in the fur around her\\neyelids and a small cloudy area with a red outline on the surface of the eye (cornea). Eye problems can be a result\\nof trauma, infection, and other medical problems and can be painful.\\n4. One dark sable, male ferret is observed to be sneezing. This ferret has yellow discharge around his nostrils.\\nRespiratory problems can result from infections, environmental conditions, and other medical problems. Without\\ntreatment these may progress and lead to unnecessary suffering.\\n5. One cinnamon colored raccoon in cage 204 has a pile of partially formed feces mixed with bright red bloody fluid\\nunder its enclosure. This animal(cid:25)'s ration of food remains un-eaten on top of its enclosure. Diarrhea and loss of\\nappetite can result from a variety of medical problems.\\n6. One dark sable ferret has a firm swelling under the right side of its jaw and extends into the neck approximately\\n3cm x 3cm. Swelling such as this in a ferret can result from problems such as infection, trauma, dental disease,\\ncancer and other medical problems and can be painful.\\n7. One sable, male ferret has a large area of moist, red skin over the shoulders and center of the back\\napproximately 2in x 1 in. Dark crusts and hair loss are also present.

The exposed skin is dark in color and thickened\\nalong the entire edge of both ears. Skin problems and hair loss can result from parasites, trauma, infection, and\\nother medical problems.\\n9. One sable, female ferret has an abnormality with her right eye. The eyeball is not visible and there is a small\\namount of brown staining around the uneven eyelids. One of the eyelids has a fleshy mass that gives the\\nappearance of a furry growth in place of the eye. The causes of this could range from simply not having an eyeball\\nto having the eyeball obscured by infection, trauma, etc. Veterinary examination and diagnosis are necessary to\\ndetermine the appropriate treatment plan.\\n10.

This information, including the diagnosis,\\ntreatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.\\n*** At least 50 percent of the raccoons are exhibiting abnormal repetitive (stereotypic) behaviors at the time of\\ninspection. These animals were each moving with varying patterns, but the pattern shown is consistent for each\\naffected animals. The patterns expressed included:\\n- Several raccoons were observed pacing. These animals were consistently quickly walking several steps,\\nturning, and returning to the starting location. Generally, effected animals were consistently pacing along one\\nenclosure wall although a few did turn and begin pacing at the opposite end of the enclosure when approached.\\nThis pacing behavior was exhibited consistently when observed for several minutes, and the path was generally\\nonly altered when another animal interfered or it was otherwise interrupted by noise or approaching.\\n- Several raccoons were observed weaving / bobbing. These animals were observed quickly shifting weight from\\none hind foot to the other while reaching with the forelimbs from one side to the other. Occasionally this was also\\nseen in combination with movement of the head up and down. Generally this motion was facing outwards from the\\nenclosure and several animals were observed rubbing their heads on the enclosure wires while preforming this\\nmotion. A few animals had areas of hair loss on the head which corresponded to the areas that they were rubbing\\non the wires as they repeated this behavior. This includes a dark color male raccoon in enclosure number 285 that\\nhas hair loss on the head over the right eye. The skin central to this hair loss has a central area that appears\\nred-brown consistent with an abrasion. A male raccoon in enclosure 288 was observed weaving and also has\\nareas of hair loss over both eyes, though the underlying skin appears normal on this animal.\\n- Several raccoons were observed wall walking. This behavior was often observed in conjunction with pacing, and\\nanimals were observed quickly walking along the kennel and then turning by partially extending their hind legs and\\nwalking their front end up the wall of the enclosure. The extension of the hind limbs is limited by the enclosure\\nheight (18in per the licensee).\\nSeveral individual animals were observed for 5-10 minutes each and the behavior continued generally without\\nsignificant variation, though some animals shortened strides moving from pacing into weaving as time progressed.\\nAnimals continued these behaviors until interrupted such as by another animal entering their path or by noise.\\nRaccoons were observed both cage-side and from a distance and were seen exhibiting these behaviors well before\\napproached by inspectors or the licensee. These abnormal behaviors also continued for the entire duration that\\ninspectors were in the building, even once they had left the immediate area of the particular enclosure. When asked\\nabout the behaviors, the licensee stated (cid:24)that is what raccoons do(cid:25). Abnormal repetitive behaviors, often called\\nstereotypies, can develop in response to many stressors including: lack of total space, lack of the ability to hide\\nfrom other individuals or humans, overcrowding, incompatibility of animals, and over or under stimulation in their\\nenvironment. Because these behaviors often develop in response to distress, they are important indicators of\\nbehavioral ill-health and require veterinary intervention to properly diagnosis the most likely causes and prevent\\nfarther deterioration by providing an appropriate treatment plan to address the stressor as well as the abnormal\\nbehavior. Correct by having the raccoons evaluated by the attending veterinarian for diagnosis of the cause of\\nthese behaviors and development of an appropriate treatment plan to address this issue. Written documentation\\nthe Attending Veterinarian(cid:25)s recommendations regarding alterations to cage space, provisions of hide areas,\\nenrichment, and any other steps necessary to address this abnormality shall be maintained by the licensee for\\nreview by APHIS Officials. Additionally, the licensee shall maintain documentation of the implementation of these\\nrecommendations for review.\",\n",

Documentation of the examination of this animal(cid:25)'s tail, including\\nany diagnostic testing, monitoring and treatment plans, plan for re-evaluation for resolution of the condition, needs\\nto be made and available for review by APHIS inspectors.\\n**DIRECT--The male leopard, Bagheera, had at least two areas of missing hair and reddened, raw looking skin on\\nhis tail. One of the care staff accompanying the inspection mentioned that he had been known to suck his tail\\nsometimes and the lesions could be from that behavior. The current areas had not been documented by care staff\\nnor reported to the AV for evaluation. This animal needs to be examined by the AV with documentation of possible\\ndiagnosis, observation and treatment plans, and plans to be re-evaluated and follow-up on his condition by the AV.\\n- Two adult male leopards, Bagheera and Jabaree, were noted to have unusual pigmentation of their left eyes.\\nBagheera had a block of brown-copper color on the pigmented portion of the eye and Jabaree(cid:25)'s entire left eye\\nappeared to be reddish-brown in color. The licensee stated that the leopards(cid:25) have had this condition since they\\nwere cubs but the APHIS inspectors have never been able to observe these animals during inspection as they\\nalways hide in their enclosures or den boxes when the licensee is accompanying the inspection. The licensee was\\nnot present during this portion of the inspection and the leopards both came up to the enclosure fencing and\\nallowed a thorough examination. This is not a normal presentation for the eyes of leopards and there is no\\ndocumentation or information indicating what is causing the condition, how long it has been present, or whether\\nthere is any need for monitoring and treatment of the eye condition by the AV. Changes in the coloration of the eye\\nmay be a genetic condition or could indicate an underlying problem such as infection and needs to be evaluated by\\nthe AV.\\n- A male serval named Limpopo was pacing the front of his enclosure during this inspection and was noted to have\\nseveral rough areas in his hair coat on his back. This may be matted hair which can be due to lack of grooming or\\nunderlying injury or infection and should be evaluated by the AV.\\n- Three ring tailed lemurs, Bongo, Talisa, and Taz, were noted to have significant thinning and hair loss on their tails\\nthat had not been documented by the care staff nor evaluated by the AV. Thinning hair and loss of hair may be a\\nsign of overgrooming by conspecifics or by the individual animal due to stress or dominance issues, underlying\\nveterinary condition (endocrine, infection, allergies), or due to trauma to the hair follicles and needs to be evaluated\\nby the AV. Documentation of examination of these animals(cid:25)' tails, including any diagnostic testing, monitoring and\\ntreatment plans, plan for re-evaluation for resolution of the condition needs to be made and available for review by\\nAPHIS inspectors.\\n--A ring tailed lemur named Abu was noted to be obese and had prominent raised areas on both hip areas. The\\ncare staff accompanying this portion of the inspection had not noted this condition and no documentation of this was\\navailable for APHIS at the time of the inspection. The licensee stated during the exit briefing that these were saddle\\nbags(cid:29) but the AV had not examined this animal to determine what was causing the raised areas or lumps on Abu'(cid:25)s\\nhips which may be excess fat or may be a due to a veterinary condition .\\n- A hedgehog named Cow was noted to be awake and actively running around his enclosure in the Welcome Center\\nduring daylight hours (nocturnal animal typically). Both of his eyes appeared to have white centers which may\\nindicate cataracts or another veterinary condition that may affect his vision. This condition had not been noted by\\nany of the care staff nor had the AV been notified at the time of this inspection.\\n- The carnivores (tigers, lions, bears, caracal, serval, savannah cat, leopards, bobcat, cougar) are not being fed a\\ncommercially prepared diet that is nutritionally complete. No diet plan is documented nor approved by the AV for\\nthese animals and there is no way to determine that they are receiving adequate nutrition to meet their physiological\\nneeds. Numerous animals were obese, especially the leopards, bobcat, and serval, while one tiger was in thin body\\ncondition and there are several young growing animals that require more vitamin and mineral supplementation than\\nadults to meet their growth needs. One of the care staff that was responsible for feeding these animals was\\nquestioned about the supplements provided for this non-commercial, meat-based diet and there is no measuring of\\nthe vitamin or mineral supplements so there is no way to be sure the animals are receiving an appropriate dose.\\nFor example, dicalcium phosphate is dusted on one piece of meat that is fed to the tigers and lions according to the\\ncare staff. The recommended dose for dicalcium phosphate as a supplement for big cats that are being fed a\\nmeat-based diet is 8.8 grams added to 1 lb of meat and just dusting one piece of meat is not likely to be adequate to\\nmeet these animals daily requirement of calcium. Additionally, the licensee hand-raises tiger cubs and does not\\nhave a documented diet plan to ensure these cubs receive the appropriate nutrition to ensure their healthy growth to\\nadulthood.\\nAnimals that are not being fed a commercially prepared, nutritionally complete diet appropriate for the species and\\nto ensure their health and well-being need to have a diet plan documented and approved by the AV that is\\nmaintained, followed, updated as necessary for new animals or changes in their age or physiologic needs, and able\\nto be reviewed by APHIS inspectors.\\nThe facility must have an established program of veterinary care which ensures problems are identified and\\ncommunicated to the AV and that appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat veterinary conditions\\nare used.\\nThe following animals need to examined by the AV by 14 Jan 2015:\\nTiger Rajah, Tiger Ojaus, Kangaroo Rascal, Leopard Bagheera\\nAll other animals and the nutrition plan for any animals not receiving a commercially prepared diet for their species\\nand physiologic needs must be evaluated by the AV by 2 Feb 2015.\",\n",

There was no indication a physical examination was performed\\nand it appears that only a visual examination occurred. No treatment was administered for this neurological\\ncondition until 7-6-15. Public concern with Sarabi exhibiting neurological symptoms was noted. On 7-6-2015 the\\nAV prescribed Cephalexin 1500 mg. po, q8h. An entry on 7-24-2015 by the AV states meds were given without\\nincident and on AV visual examination, the tiger did not have a head tilt and breathing was assessed to be back to\\nnormal. There is no park treatment log or record that the prescribed medication was administered to Sarabi.\\nAn entry record from the AV on 8-24-2015 states drooling was observed from the right side of the mouth and no\\ntreatment, diagnosis, or plan was noted. Eight days later on the morning of 9-1-2015 the AV made an entry that the\\ntiger was (cid:28)down(cid:29) the previous evening; panting heavy and not eating. She described the tiger as depressed, still\\ndrooling, clear nasal discharge and walking to water but not drinking. The AV diagnosis was abscessed tooth. The\\nAV plan included return later in evening to sedate the tiger and performed a physical examination, collect blood, and\\nperform a dental extraction. After sedation, her physical examination findings included (cid:28)sloppy heart sounds(cid:29), clear\\nnasal discharge, possible cloudy left eye, no wheezing or crackle, but lung sounds were (cid:28)not crisp(cid:29), teeth (cid:28)looked\\ngreat(cid:29), a tiny tear was noted in the upper gum line at left canine; a piece of bone was noted to be wedged in the\\narea and was removed. No obvious abdominal masses were palpated, no external parasites were observed, and\\npossible mild dehydration was noted. The tiger was awake and walking after anesthetic reversal administered. On\\n9-2-2015 an entry was made that in the AV medical notes that Sarabi was ambulatory and eating. On the morning\\nof 9-6-2015 Sarabi was found dead in her enclosure. From the records complied by the inspectors from the AV and\\nthe facility it appears Sarabi has been unhealthy starting in July 2015 until her death September 6, 2015. During this\\nperiod of time she received one round of antibiotics and one physical examination. No other treatment was\\nadministered or prescribed. The only diagnostic tested preformed on Sarabi were a CBC and chemistry profile two\\ndays prior to her death. The chronological order of events and documentation were difficult to determine because\\nthe AV facility walk through notes are the only records maintained by the facility. Multiple areas regarding this\\nanimal\\'s condition were missing, poorly recorded, or not provided to the inspectors in a reasonable time period after\\nthe actual inspection.

The hair above\\nthe left eye is vertically pulled over the eye and matted down into this crusted material around the lower eyelid,\\ncausing the hair both above and below the eye to pull at the skin when the dog blinks or opens its eye. This crusted\\nmaterial and hair also interferes with her ability to see. (DIRECT)\\n* \"(cid:28)Luther\",(cid:29) a male Wheaton Terrier (#48345B3821) has an excessively matted hair coat.

    "\n",
    "- At 419 narratives, the heat/temperature flag has just 2% coverage of total narratives\n",
    "    - TFIDF values for heat and temperature are also low, not in top ~300 terms <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mention of “heat” does not always mean the inspection revealed the animal was subject to overheating/excessive cooling.\n",
    "    - Why? “Overheating” or \"heat\" is often a sub-item in a standardized list of ways an animal should not be treated. The sentiment roughly reads (the exact phrasing changes; possibly a sentence included in some guiding inspection document): “all handling of animals should be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause **overheating**, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.”\n",
    "        - 144 narratives contain the substring “carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause” (likely an undercount of the sub-item phenomenon)\n",
    "    - Additionally, heat/temperature can also be used to describe an outcome to prevent, for example: \"... repair the electrical outlet and then determine the capability of the unit to insure in can store food at the proper **temperature** and humidity.\"<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Filtering narratives according to mention of heat/temperature still results in diverse inspection findings/recommendations\n",
    "     - Animals suffered from overheating \n",
    "         - E.g. \"The initial corrective action was insufficient to maintain the appropriate temperature\\nfor hamsters, leading to an ambient temperature of >85 degrees for more than 12 hour\" \n",
    "        - \"On May 2, 2022, four Damaraland mole rats were found dead in their enclosures. According to facility personnel, an\\nelectric space heater that was being used to provide supplemental heat for the animals was somehow placed under the\\nmetal rack holding the enclosures resulting in the animals overheating.\"\n",
    "    - Improper sanitization procedures\n",
    "        - \"The facility could not verify that the Guinea Pig primary enclosures are being adequately sanitized. The facility currently\\nuses temperature-tapes to verify that the correct temperature (180 degrees Fahrenheit) is reached by the automated\\nwashing systems.

    "### Questions\n",
    "- What is the purpose behind identifying narratives involving heat/temperature?\n",
    "    - A frequently occuring inspection theme is flaws in animals' enclosures. Inadequate enclosures can lead to animal overheating/underheating. Should the flag focus on the outcome (overheating/underheating) or the initial failure in enclosure maintenance/construction?\n",
    "- What are more useful flags for assisting future analysis of this dataset? \n",
    "- Should flags aim for broadness/coverage? Or should flags identify very specific/rare phenomenons?"

       " 'On 19 August 2014, the intermediate handler transported a load of 380 rabbits in 190 cartons (2 rabbits per\\nenclosure).

The next day one additional rabbit also expired, which was also\\nsuspected to have been caused by the respiratory stress experienced in transit. An investigation of the\\ncircumstances of the shipment revealed that the primary enclosures used to house the rabbits were of a larger size\\nthan the intermediate handler had anticipated, so the cargo area of the truck was too small to allow adequate airflow\\nbetween cages and subsequent ventilation to the animals housed therein. The driver noted the discrepancy in the\\ndimensions of the boxes that had been ordered vs. those that had been delivered for shipment, but the animals\\nwere loaded onto the truck despite this, and the transport proceeded as planned. The driver stopped to observe the\\nanimals mid-shipment and no abnormalities were noted; however, the 32 rabbits were discovered to be dead upon\\narrival at their final destination.\\nInadequate space in the cargo space used to transport animals can have a significant impact on their ability to\\nbreathe normally.

Deficiency in airflow and adequate ventilation caused significant animal impacts, i.e., the loss of 9% of the\\nload (33 of 380 animals).\\nThe primary enclosures used to transport rabbits must be positioned in a manner that each rabbit has sufficient air\\nfor normal breathing. The intermediate handler has taken corrective measures to prevent further incidents,\\nincluding re-training all of the drivers and painting a pattern of lines on the walls of the cargo areas of the vehicles\\nused to transport animals, such that any primary enclosure must be fitted inside the areas designated by the paint\\nlines in order for there to be sufficient airflow and ventilation.

       " \"***On May 10, 2015 the facility noted that a young male juvenile lion, Thor, was displaying inappropriate mentation\\nand had limited mobility. According to the facility, the Attending Veterinarian was consulted regarding the condition\\nof the juvenile and examined the animal on May 10, 2015 and June 19, 2015. The veterinarian assessed the animal\\nvisually and produced a differential diagnosis of Dandy-Walker syndrome. As of July 14, 2015 the veterinarian\\nscheduled for additional diagnostics to include blood-work and a MRI. The facility management was unable to\\nproduce records regarding the veterinary treatment plan for this animal. The records that were able to be produced\\nindicated the date of the initial visual assessment by the veterinarian, the differential diagnosis of Dandy Walker\\nsyndrome, and a plan for future diagnostics. Between the time when the facility first noted issues with the animal\\nand the date of the inspection, the veterinarian had not taken any diagnostic samples from the animal to support a\\ndiagnosis. Limited records were able to be produced regarding the care of the animals at Living Treasures Animal\\nPark. During the inspection on July 14, 2015 the juvenile lion was housed in the back holding area of the enclosure\\nand remained in a resting position refusing to rise after being prompted with food. The facility offered a video\\nrecording as a representation of the juvenile(cid:25)s movement. In this recording the animal appeared to be stiff on all four\\nlimbs and reluctant to move, even for short distances. On July 15, 2015 the juvenile was in the main enclosure with\\nhis mother, the animal remained in a laying position and there were no apparent signs of injury during our\\nobservation. The facility representatives indicated that the juvenile was still very stiff in his movements, but had\\nshowed interest in playing with his mother immediately after his release into the main enclosure. He had a\\nroughened hair coat that had a moderate amount of mud along his back and on all four legs consistent with the\\nanimal(cid:25)'s movement around or through the mud within the enclosure. The documented diet for this animal includes\\n7lbs. of mixed red meat and poultry and to be supplemented with Platinum Performance: Exotic Wellness and\\nPerformance Formula. During conversation with the facility management, they stated this animal refuses to eat the\\nbones within the meat fed. This current feeding program provides very little calcium and other nutrients for the\\ngrowing animal. Upon inspection of the supplement there was a white film on the surface and the supplement was\\nheavily caked providing clear evidence that the supplement was not being consistently used. After speaking with the\\nveterinarian regarding the care of this animal, her initial assessment of the inappropriate mentation was made on\\nMay 4, 2015. In the record for that date she suspected neurologic disease, she recommended deworming and\\nantihistamine therapy. She completed a second visual assessment on June 19, 2015, when she noted weight loss\\nand recommended tranquilization for a hands on physical exam and further diagnostics. On the second visual\\nassessment, the veterinarian'(cid:25)s differential diagnoses were Dandy-Walker syndrome, vestibular disease or\\nincomplete fusion of cervical vertebra. According to the attending veterinarian, a dietary cause was not explored\\nbecause the adults were receiving the same diet and showed no signs of illness. The failure to understand that\\nyoung, growing large carnivores may have additional nutritional needs show a clear lack of adequate training and\\nveterinary care. Metabolic Bone Disease is a common disease of young big cats. This disease stems from\\ninadequate levels of calcium in the diet. During early development the animal will need an increased level of\\ncalcium in the diet to allow for bone growth. At the time of the inspection there was no evidence that the diet has the\\nproper nutritive values to maintain the animal in good health. The deficiency of adequate nutrition may have caused\\nthis animal severe animal welfare concerns. The length in time to get diagnostic information about the lion(cid:25)'s\\ncondition and the lack of attention to investigate the nutritional value of the lion(cid:25)'s diet illustrate that appropriate\\nmethods were not taken to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases.

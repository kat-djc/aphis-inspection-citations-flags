Due to construction variability, the flooring frequently\\nleaves gaps up to two inches along the front and/or sides of the enclosure. These gaps are large enough for a foot or leg\\nto pass through the openings. Throughout the inspection, at least 130 enclosures had these gaps present and dogs were\\nseen with toes in the gaps.\\n*** Several enclosures in Buildings G1 and G2 also have flooring that is not properly supported from underneath. These\\nfloors consistently bounce, vibrate, or tilt as the dogs move across the floors.\\n*** Gaps were also noticed in the fencing where the chain link had become detached from the frame in Building G1 Room\\n4. One gap in the fencing was only a few inches (enough to trap a foot or leg) and located in the corner by the waterer.\\nAnother gap was the length of the enclosure sidewall. Two adjacent pens share a common chain-link side wall that is\\nunattached at the base of the enclosure. The metal at the bottom of the wall had rusted to the point of breaking off,\\nleaving a sharp point at floor level. The entire section of chain link forming the barrier between enclosures is no longer\\nattached to the metal frame. This allowed the chain-link to swing easily when dogs were jumping on or pushing against\\nthe chain-link. The fencing was so loose that a dog would be able to simply push their way under it to enter the adjacent\\nenclosure.\\n*** Multiple enclosures in Buildings G1 and G2 have sharp points at the levels of the dogs. These sharp points are\\nprimarily caused by metal that has rusted to the point of disintegration and left behind sharp edges.\\n*** A review of medical records for dogs treated for injuries between 11/18/21 and 3/8/22 revealed one dog injured by the\\nenclosure. A female beagle, CMJCIN, was found on 1/11/22 with her left rear leg caught in the door.

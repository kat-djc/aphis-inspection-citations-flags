    "1.  Recorded Temperatures\n",
    "    - We use a Regex pattern to flag narratives containing recorded temperatures (80.5 degrees, 52 F, 25 Celsius) but exclude non-temperature related mentions of \"degrees\" (degrees of rust, degrees of hair loss). We also exclude mentions of \"180 degrees\" which is the water temperature required for proper sanitization and an extremely improbable ambient temperature on Earth. \n",

    "    - We use keywords related to overheating/excessive cooling to flag relevant narratives. To avoid capture of narratives mentioning heating equipment (heating pads, heated blankets), the majority of keywords are results of extreme ambient temperatures: heat stress, hypothermia, heat stroke, frostbite, etc.\n",

Of the 8 large feline\\ncarnivores at the facility, three (2 leopards and 1 tiger) were determined to be severely malnourished and are not\\nbeing provided with sufficient quantity or quality of food to maintain the animals in good health. The physical\\ncondition of each individual animal is described in detail above. When interviewed following the inspection, the\\nattending veterinarian stated he thought the large feline carnivores were thin and he estimated their body condition\\nto be (cid:28)2 out of 5(cid:29). There was no meat or meat storage available for inspection. When instructed, the licensee did\\nproduce two chicken thighs and when one was offered to the black leopard identified as Jumonji who appeared\\nravenous snatching the chicken and running off to eat it. Based on conflicting statements made by the licensee\\nregarding his current feeding practices it appears that none of the large cats at this facility are receiving adequate\\nfood.\\nAccording to the licensee, he does not store meat on the property and buys fresh meat every day or two. When\\nasked where he keeps stored meat the licensee stated he (cid:28)keeps it at Kroger(cid:29) and farther stated that APHIS\\nOfficials could call them if we wanted. The licensee stated that he feeds two 40 lb cases of chicken thighs (80 lbs\\ntotal) each day to provide meat for all of his meat-eating animals (3 tigers, 3 leopards, 2 cougar, 3 bears, 1 bobcat,\\n3 foxes, 2 wolves). According to the feeding plan provided by the facility these animals should be receiving a total\\nof 147.5 to 179.5 lbs of meat daily (with no fasting days). When asked about individual animal feeding the licensee\\nstated that he is feeding approximately 20 lbs of meat each day to each of the tigers, leopards, cougar, and bear.\\nThe licensee was asked for the amounts fed to each species and individual several times during the inspection and\\nthe amounts described ranged from 16-20 lbs for all species (including the smaller cats). This is in excess of the\\namounts specified by the feeding plan for the cougars and leopards. Feeding each of these animals 20 lbs per day\\nwould require 220lbs of meat daily (not including that fed to the fox, bobcat, and wolves) and is inconsistent with\\nprevious statements that he is purchasing and feeding 80 lbs total each day. When asked where he purchases\\nmeat, the licensee stated that he obtains it from the local Kroger supermarket. The meat manager at this store\\nreported that the licensee has only picked up twice in the last three weeks (on 1/8/15 and a few days later). Both\\npick-ups were for 4 cases (a total of 320 lbs in the last 3 weeks). According to the nutrition program signed by the\\nAV, this would provide enough meat for only 2 days. In addition to the purchased meat, the licensee also reports\\nfeeding deer donated from Ohio Department of Transportation and other sources. The timing and quantity of the\\ndonated meat is unpredictable and unreliable. The licensee has no records of the donated meat, so the quantity\\ncould not be verified. The licensee indicated multiple times he was having money problems. He stated he wanted to\\nmake improvements (cid:28)but everything cost money(cid:29). Based on the conflicting statements made by the licensee it is\\nunclear how much meat or what type is actually being fed to the animals. It is clear, however, based on the poor\\nbody condition shown by several animals that the current feeding practices are inadequate to maintain all of these\\nanimals in good health. Since the previous inspection the one cougar (the adult female cited on the previous report)\\nappears to have gained a moderate amount of weight, however, this animal remains underweight and several other\\nanimals now have a noticeable weight loss. The animals currently most severely affected include the two black\\nleopards (Jumonji & Backara) and the female white tiger (Tamara). Prolonged failure to feed an adequate amount\\n(or appropriate type) of feed results in weight loss and chronic malnutrition. Additionally, prolonged hunger from\\nchronic malnutrition and starvation are distressful to the animals and results in unnecessary suffering. When left\\nuncorrected this is likely to result in death and one other cougar previously identified as underweight recently died\\nfrom an undetermined cause. During periods of cold weather, animals such as these with inadequate fat reserves\\nare at significant risk of farther discomfort, disease and death. All licensees must ensure that animals are fed food\\nwhich is wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain\\nall animals in good health. The financial concerns expressed by the licensee combined with the lack of food on the\\nproperty, the inability to store meat, and apparent underfeeding of all big cats show a clear immediate risk to all\\nlarge cats present at the facility. Purchasing food on a daily or alternate day basis (as described by the licensee) is\\nclearly not working to provide adequate nutrition in this case. The licensee must have adequate facilities and stored\\nfood to continue to meet the nutritional needs of these animals during periods of time that meat cannot be\\npurchased (such as inclement weather or insufficient supply).

When the\\ninspectors took part in the interaction, they found that the bike rack fence reached to the bottom of their bust area, a\\nheight of 47 inches, about 4 feet. By extending an arm, with the elbow at the level of the bike rack and the hand covering\\nhalf of the tongs, the inspector was able to reach the tiger enclosure. The tongs are 16 inches long per the licensee and\\nthe length between the inspector’s elbow and hand is 15 inches. When adding it together, the distance between the bike\\nrack barrier and the tiger’s enclosure was approximately 23 inches, about 2 feet. The way in which public feeding is being\\nconducted by this exhibitor poses significant public and animal safety risks. Even with metal flaps placed one third of the\\nway down from the tips of the tongs, approximately 5 inches could still penetrate the enclosure. The tigers could suffer\\ninjuries from the scalloped edged tongs. In such close proximity, the public could be injured from accidentally coming into\\ncontact with the tigers. During public exhibition, animals must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal\\nand to the public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public to assure the\\nsafety of animals and the public.

Although the licensee stated that he had not\\ncontacted the Attending Veterinarian (AV) for advice regarding veterinary treatment for either of these oryx, he also\\nstated that he had previously discussed the issue of lameness in oryx generally with the partner of the AV (also\\nanother licensed veterinarian). The licensee stated as long as there is not a compound fracture, the animal should\\nnot be removed from the herd for further evaluation and treatment regarding lameness since it may just be a sprain\\nor similar minor injury. There was no record of any previous advice from any veterinarian and no written guidance\\npresent in the program of veterinary care for lameness in oryx or any other species. No veterinary care was\\nprovided to either oryx listed above. Lameness is a significant indicator of pain and failure to provide appropriate\\nmethods to properly diagnose and treat the underlying cause in a timely manner may result in unnecessary pain\\nand suffering. Correct by having these animals evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and following all\\nrecommendations including those regarding examination, diagnosis, treatment, and future recheck examinations as\\nneeded. Additionally, the licensee must maintain record of these recommendations for evaluation by APHIS\\nOfficials. If this is a recurrent problem the licensee may seek additional guidance from the Attending Veterinarian\\nfor incorporation into the written program of veterinary care regarding recommendations for any future animals that\\nmay develop lameness. This was first identified to the licensee on 6 January 2015.\\n*** DIRECT: Several guinea pigs (GP) were exhibiting varying amounts of hair loss at the time of inspection. Tubs\\n1& 2 were located on the patio outside the keeper area. Tub 3 was located in the storage trailer near the mouse\\nhouse.\\n- GP#1: A black and white juvenile guinea pig located in tub 1 had an area of hair loss on the right side of its\\nnose stretching 2/3 of the way to its eye. The underlying skin in this area was dry, crusty, and had several dark\\nspots that appeared to be scabs. Additionally, there was a small amount of crusted skin under the right eye. This\\nwas first identified to the licensee on 6 January 2014.\\n- GP#2: A black and white adult guinea pig located in tub 1 had several small areas of hair loss on the left side\\nof its nose. The underlying skin was dry, flaky, and had several dark spots that appeared to be scabs. This was\\nfirst identified to the licensee on 6 January 2014.\\n- GP#3: A tan and white juvenile guinea pig located in tub 2 had several small areas of hair loss on the right side\\nof its face near its eye, on the top of its head, and at the base of the right ear. The underlying skin was dry and in\\nthe area on top of the head it was flaky and had dark spots that appeared to be scabs. This was first identified to\\nthe licensee on 6 January 2014.\\n- GP#4: A brown juvenile guinea pig located in tub 2 had an area of hair loss on the right side of its nose\\nextending from the nose to the right eye and over the bridge of the nose. The underlying skin in this area was dry,\\ncrusty, and had numerous spots of medium and dark red areas that appeared to be scabs. This was first identified\\nto the licensee on 6 January 2014.\\n- GP#5: A brown and white guinea pig located in tub 2 had a small area of hair loss on the bridge of the nose.\\nThe underlying skin was dry and without significant crusts or flakes. This was first identified to the licensee on 6\\nJanuary 2014.\\n- GP#6: A tan guinea pig with a white stripe between its eyes located in tub 1 has an area of hair loss on the\\nbridge of the nose. The underlying skin is dry, flaky, and has one dark spot that appeared to be a scab. This was\\nfirst identified to the licensee on 7 January 2014.\\n- GP#7: A brown and white guinea pig located in tub 1 has an area of hair loss extending between the left eye\\nand ear. The underlying skin is dry and flaky. This was first identified to the licensee on 7 January 2014.\\n- GP#8: A black and white guinea pig located in tub 3 has an area of hair loss and irregular skin just above its\\nright eye and a second spot just behind the nose on the right side. The skin surrounding the eye appears dry,\\nthickened, and leathery while the area near the nose is dry and flaky. This was first identified to the licensee on 7\\nJanuary 2014.\\n- GP#9: A brown and white curly coated guinea pig located in tub 3 has a focal area of incomplete hair loss on\\nthe bridge of its nose. The underlying skin is dry and flaky. This was first identified to the licensee on 7 January\\n2014.\\n- GP#10: A brown and white curly coated guinea pig located in tub 3 has areas of hair loss on the top of the\\nhead and under the left ear. The underlying skin in both areas is dry and crusty. This was first identified to the\\nlicensee on 7 January 2014.\\nAll of the guinea pigs listed above appeared bright, alert, and reactive. None were observed actively scratching at\\nthe affected areas, however, the dark spots present on several animals appear to be scabs and dried blood and are\\nconsistent with scratching as a result of itchiness. These conditions were not reported to the attending veterinarian\\nprior to inspection and none of these animals were receiving any treatment for these conditions. Hair loss can result\\nfrom numerous causes including several infectious causes such as fungal and bacterial diseases. Given the\\nnumber of animals with similar lesions, the cause is likely to be infectious. When the attending veterinarian\\nobserved these animals, on 8 January 2015, he stated that the lesions were suspicious for ringworm and would\\nmake a diagnostic / treatment plan accordingly. Infectious skin disorders may be transmitted to other uninfected\\nanimals in the same enclosure or enclosures nearby. Numerous animals which appeared normal were housed with\\naffected animals in each tub listed above. The licensee stated that he had not contacted the attending veterinarian\\nregarding these issues prior to the start of the inspection and there were no methods in place to prevent spread of\\nthis condition. There was no previous guidance from the attending veterinarian for skin disorders in guinea pigs and\\nno written guidance in the program of veterinary care. Correct by ensuring that all animals exhibiting these skin\\nabnormalities are examined by a licensed veterinarian so that appropriate diagnostic testing can be completed and\\na proper diagnosis can be made. Additionally, the licensee must seek guidance from the attending veterinarian\\nregarding appropriate treatment for the affected animals as well as prevention and control of this condition in the\\nguinea pig colony. Records of these recommendations must be maintained for evaluation by APHIS Officials.\\n*** Three camels located in the camel exhibit area in the main zoo location showed signs of abnormal skin\\nconditions. These were identified to the licensee on 6 January 2015.\\n- Camel #1: A female camel had a significant swelling (at least 7 inches by 3 inches) located on the right side at\\nthe base of the hump. Additionally, there is a large area of dark discharge (brown, red, and black) extending from\\nthe swelling down the right side to the abdomen. This discharge appears dried and caked in the fur.\\n- Camel #2: A female camel had a significant swelling on the left shoulder area (approximately 3 inches and\\nroughly circular). The skin overlying this area is hairless and there is dried red-brown material caked in the fur\\nsurrounding the lesion. This camel was later identified by the facility as \"(cid:28)Lauren\"(cid:29).\\n- Camel #3: A female camel (with an ear tag #5) had a swelling on the right mid-neck. There was a brown-red\\ndischarge caked in the surrounding fur.\\nWhen asked about these lesions, the licensee stated that they are abscesses and that they occur regularly in the\\ncamels. He stated that they are treated by the facility staff (typically his wife) whenever they are observed. He\\nfurther stated that typically they would not call the attending veterinarian for these issues since they are a common\\noccurrence and they have been treating them for years. When asked, the wife of the licensee stated that she had\\ncleaned the abscess on (cid:28)\"Lauren\"(cid:29) prior to the inspection (on 3 January 2015) by flushing it with diluted iodine and\\nspraying it with wound spray. There is currently no written guidance in the program of veterinary care which would\\nallow treatment by the facility without consultation from the attending veterinarian. Abscesses are often caused by\\ninfectious agents and there are 5 additional camels located in this pasture and 1 housed so that it is sharing the\\nsame barn (with direct contact). There were no methods currently in use to stop the spread of disease if it is\\ntransmissible between animals. Correct by ensuring that all animals exhibiting these skin abnormalities are\\nexamined by a licensed veterinarian so that appropriate diagnostic testing can be completed and a proper diagnosis\\ncan be made. Additionally, the licensee must seek guidance from the attending veterinarian regarding appropriate\\ntreatment for the affected animals as well as prevention and control of this condition in the camels. The licensee\\nmust maintain records of the diagnosis and recommendations for evaluation by APHIS Officials.\\n*** The male cougar has an area on the right hind leg where the skin appears reddened and moist. The area is\\napproximately 2 inches wide by 4 inches long and is located on the back of the leg behind the right knee. This was\\nidentified to the licensee on 6 January 2015 and at that time the licensee stated that he was unaware of this\\ncondition. It was identified to the wife of the licensee on 7 January 2015 and she also stated she was unaware of\\nthe condition but would make sure the attending veterinarian was called to examine it. Skin disease can result from\\nnumerous infectious and non-infectious causes. Left untreated, it may progress resulting in unnecessary discomfort\\nor suffering. Correct by ensuring that this animal is examined by a licensed veterinarian for recommendations\\nregarding appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The licensee must maintain records of the diagnosis and\\nrecommendations for evaluation by APHIS Officials.\\n*** One female giraffe had hooves which were overgrown and a slightly abnormal gait when compared to the other\\ngiraffes at the facility. When asked about routine giraffe hoof care the licensee stated that the giraffe will naturally\\nwear their hooves down in the yard since there is gravel present in the giraffe enclosure. This individual giraffe was\\nidentified to the licensee on 6 January 2015 at which time the licensee stated that he was not sure of the individual\\nanimal(cid:25)\\'s name although he thought it may be Vivian. When the animal with long hooves was pointed out, the\\nlicensee assured inspectors that the hooves would wear to a normal length over time if left on the gravel. The\\nlicensee further assured the inspectors that if that did not happen he would be able to transport the giraffe to North\\nCarolina when the weather warms to trim her hooves using a chute at another USDA licensee(cid:25)\\'s facility.\\nAdditionally, he stated that they were in the process of constructing a giraffe chute to facilitate easier handling of the\\ngiraffe and make hoof trimming easier in the future. There was no documentation at the facility that the licensee\\nhas guidance from the Attending Veterinarian regarding the treatment of overgrown hooves in giraffe. Inspectors\\ndid observe a partially constructed chute. Excessively long hooves can progress causing abnormal gaits,\\nlameness, unnecessary stress and discomfort to the animal. Correct by having this animal examined by a licensed\\nveterinarian and following all recommendations regarding appropriate treatment for this condition. If transportation\\nof this animal is necessary for treatment, this guidance should include an appropriate timeline for providing this\\ncare. Additionally, the licensee must maintain records of the diagnosis and recommendations for evaluation by\\nAPHIS Officials. This was first identified to the licensee on 6 January 2014.\\n*** Numerous Capuchin Monkeys had hair loss to varying degrees and were observed scratching during the\\ninspection. This included:\\n- Capuchin #1: A Brown (Tufted) Capuchin monkey located in the keeper barn had significant hair loss over its\\nentire back extending over its sides and shoulders. Additionally there was a smaller area of hair loss on its tail. The\\nunderlying skin appeared dry. This capuchin was housed with two other monkeys (one of which is capuchin #2\\nlisted below). This animal was observed scratching during the inspection.\\n- Capuchin #2: A Brown (Tufted) Capuchin monkey located in the keeper barn had significant hair loss along the\\nlength of its tail (worst at the tip) as well as hair thinning over the rump area and back. This animal was periodically\\nobserved scratching during the course of the inspection. This capuchin was housed with two other monkeys\\nincluding capuchin #1 listed above).\\n- Capuchin #3: A White-faced Capuchin monkey located in the indoor/outdoor area near the mouse house\\nbuilding (co-housed with 5 other Capuchin monkeys including Capuchin #4 below) had generalized patchy hair loss\\n(over the back, hind legs, tail, etc.). This animal was observed scratching.\\n- Capuchin #4: A White-faced Capuchin monkey located in the indoor/outdoor area near the mouse house\\nbuilding (co-housed with 5 other Capuchin monkeys including Capuchin #3 above) had incomplete hair loss located\\nalong the length of the tail and its left knee.\\n- Capuchin #5: A White-faced Capuchin monkey missing part of the left index finger located in the back room of\\nthe mouse-house building had hair loss on both forearms and on the tail. The capuchin was observed vigorously\\nscratching at times during the inspection. This capuchin was co-housed with 2 others (#6 and 7 below) and in a\\nroom with two other groups of capuchins (including capuchin #8) and a group of DeBrazza\\'(cid:25)s Monkeys.\\n- Capuchin #6: A White-faced Capuchin monkey located in the back room of the mouse-house building had\\npatchy hair loss on the tail. This capuchin was co-housed with 2 others (#5 and 7) and in a room with two other\\ngroups of capuchins (including capuchin #8) and a group of DeBrazza(cid:25)\\'s Monkeys.\\n- Capuchin #7: A White-faced Capuchin monkey located in the back room of the mouse-house building had\\npatchy hair loss on the tail. This capuchin was co-housed with 2 others (#5 and 6 above) and in a room with two\\nother groups of capuchins (including capuchin #8) and a group of DeBrazza(cid:25)\\'s Monkeys.\\n- Capuchin #8: A Brown (Tufted) Capuchin monkey located in the back room of the mouse-house building had\\nextensive hair loss on its tail and several small patches on its back. This animal was observed vigorously\\nscratching at times during the inspection. This capuchin was co-housed with 2 other non-affected animals and in a\\nroom with two other groups of capuchins and a group of DeBrazza(cid:25)\\'s Monkeys.\\nThe hair loss in Capuchins #1 & 2 were first identified to the licensee on 6 January 2014. Capuchins #3 - 8 were\\nfirst identified to the licensee on 7 January 2014. There was no written documentation regarding the treatment of\\nthese animals for hair loss and the attending veterinarian stated to APHIS Officials that he would generally refer\\nprimates to another local veterinarian for treatment. Hair loss associated with apparent discomfort (evidenced by\\nscratching) can result from a number of causes including several infectious causes. Left untreated these conditions\\nmay result in worsening of the condition, development of secondary infections, and unnecessary suffering. When\\nskin disorders are resulting from an infectious cause, they may be transmitted to other uninfected animals in the\\nsame enclosure or enclosures nearby. Numerous animals which appeared normal were housed with affected\\nanimals in nearby enclosures. Correct by ensuring that all animals exhibiting these skin abnormalities are examined\\nby a licensed veterinarian so that appropriate diagnostic testing can be completed and a proper diagnosis can be\\nmade. The licensee must follow all recommendations by the veterinarian including those regarding diagnosis,\\ntreatment, prevention, control of this condition, and recheck examinations. Records of these findings, treatment,\\nand future recommendations must be kept for evaluation by APHIS Officials.\\n*** A small Mandrill housed with the adult male Mandrill had hair loss over top aspect of both forearms. On the right\\narm the hair loss extends from the elbow to hand and on the left arm it extends over a smaller portion of the arm.\\nThe underlying skin appears dry. This was first identified to the licensee on 6 January 2015 at which time he stated\\nthat this is probably due to stress because the female Mandrill in the adjacent enclosure (with limited tactile contact)\\npicks on and intimidates this animal. He stated that the female is a full-sister to this affected animal and that\\nnegative interaction is the reason they are separated. He stated that this issue has not been evaluated by a\\nveterinarian and there was no record that the facility had contacted the attending veterinarian for any evaluation.\\nThere was no direction in the written program of veterinary care or the Non-human Primate Enrichment plan to\\naddress hair loss or hair plucking in primates. While hair loss in this area of primates often has an underlying\\nbehavioral cause, guidance from the attending veterinarian must be sought to ensure appropriate diagnosis and\\ntreatment and to prevent worsening of the condition. Correct by contacting the attending veterinarian and following\\nall recommendations including his direction regarding the diagnosis, care, and treatment. Additionally, the\\nenrichment plan should be amended to address non-medical causes of hair plucking in primates if the veterinarian\\nbelieves this to be an issue at the facility.\\n***A black and white pygmy goat located in the main zoo area has a creamy white vulvar discharge, crusted\\ndischarge dried on the vulva, hair loss on flanks, and significant crusts around its nose. The end of the tail also has\\na moderate amount of dried dark debris caked in the hair which appears to be contamination from the discharge\\nmixed with dirt. The goat was bright, alert, and active and ate a small amount of grain during the inspection. The\\nabnormalities were initially observed by APHIS Officials on 6 January 2015 and continued to be present on multiple\\ndays during the inspection process. When asked about this goat, the wife of the licensee stated that this was an\\nolder goat and that she looks ok. There was no record to indicate that the facility had contacted the attending\\nveterinarian about this animal and she was not on any treatment at the start of the inspection. This was first\\nidentified to the wife of the licensee on 6 January 2015. Correct by having this animal examined by a licensed\\nveterinarian and following all recommendations regarding appropriate diagnosis and treatment for this condition.\\nAdditionally, the licensee must maintain records of the diagnosis and recommendations for evaluation by APHIS\\nOfficials.\\n*** All of the muntjac in the enclosure between the macaques and African crested porcupine (total of 6) had fur over\\ntheir rump area that was ruffled and standing on end. Two of these animals (one male and one female) had a large\\namount of dark brown material under their tails consistent with caked on diarrhea. Diarrhea can be an indicator of\\nill-health and can have many causes both infectious (parasites, bacterial disease, etc.) or non-infectious (problems\\nwith diet, individual metabolic disease, etc). Ruffled hair in the area of the rump can be an indicator of several\\nproblems such as skin disease or more generalized systemic problems. Failure to properly diagnose and treat this\\ncondition may result in the worsening of the condition and possibly spread of disease between animals (if the\\nunderlying cause is infectious). There was no documentation that the facility has contacted the Attending\\nveterinarian regarding these animals. Correct by having these animals examined by the Attending Veterinarian and\\nfollowing all recommendations regarding diagnosis, treatment, control, and prevention of this condition. Additionally\\nthe licensee must maintain record of these recommendations for evaluation by APHIS Officials. This was first\\nidentified to the licensee on 6 January 2015.\\n*** A tan and white llama located in the llama paddock in the main zoo has a mass under the jaw on the left side\\nthat has crusty debris overlying this mass. This animal appeared bright and alert. There was no documentation\\nthat the facility contacted a veterinarian regarding this animal. Masses in this area can result from numerous\\nconditions both infectious and non-infectious (such as tooth root abscess, neoplasia, etc). Failure to properly\\ndiagnose and treat this condition can result in disease progression and lead to unnecessary suffering. Correct by\\nhaving this animal examined by the Attending Veterinarian and following all recommendations. Additionally the\\nlicensee must maintain record of these findings and recommendations for evaluation by APHIS Officials. This was\\nfirst identified to the licensee on 6 January 2015.\\n*** A miniature Zebu steer located in the petting area of the main zoo had long misshapen claws on both hind legs\\nwith the right more affected than the left. The outer claw of the right rear foot appears to be partially twisted under\\nthe foot so that the steer is partially weight bearing on the outer wall. The Zebu did not appear to be lame at a walk.\\nThe wife of the licensee stated that this was an older steer and that he has always had bad feet as did his father.\\nShe also stated that the facility uses a good farrier to trim hooves, that he had trimmed the feet for this Zebu in\\nDecember, and that these are about as good as they normally look. There was no written documentation of any\\nprior hoof trims. Left untreated, long or misshapen hooves can progress and cause lameness, abnormal stress on\\nthe joints, and discomfort to the animal. While there was no record of recent farrier care, if this animal(cid:25)\\'s feet were\\ntrimmed in December, there is an increased reason to contact the Attending Veterinarian (AV) for recommendations\\nabout whether additional treatment is necessary. Correct by contacting the AV and following all recommendations\\nregarding treatment and future monitoring of this animal. Additionally the licensee must maintain records of these\\nrecommendations for evaluation by APHIS Officials. This was first identified to the wife of the licensee on 6 January\\n2015.\\nEach dealer and exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care to include the use of\\nappropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. Adequate records of veterinary\\ncare (including all treatments provided by the facility and communication of issues of health to the attending\\nveterinarian) are an integral part of an adequate program of veterinary care since they are necessary to ensure\\ncommunication between facility staff as well as between the facility and the attending veterinarian when animals are\\nexhibiting signs of medical problems or have a history of previous problems. Failure of the facility to establish and\\nmaintain an adequate program of veterinary care (including record keeping) can result in delayed veterinary\\ntreatment and prevent the attending veterinarian from making accurate diagnoses. Correct by ensuring that all\\nanimals showing signs of injury, disease, or illness are promptly examined by a licensed veterinarian and\\nmaintaining adequate records from this point forward.\\nAll animals requiring veterinary treatment identified by APHIS Officials were communicated to the licensee as they\\nwere identified. Additionally, APHIS Officials discussed a comprehensive list of animals requiring care at the\\nconclusion of 7 January 2015 with both the licensee and his wife.

Business that includes the purchase and resale of animals require a Class B USDA license. The licensee\\nmust not purchase and re-sell animals from other sources without first obtaining this Class B license. Failure to\\nmaintain the appropriate valid USDA license makes the tracking of animals and maintenance of the license,\\nincluding proper renewals of that license, difficult to impossible.

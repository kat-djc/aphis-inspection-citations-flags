current policy. The employees are supposed to lock all tigers out of the arena, then enter and place the meat in 16
separate piles at least 15 feet apart. The licensee believes the injury was likely a scratch or bite which occurred

1e568f222c7d9f93,3.125(a),Critical,True,"FACILITIES, GENERAL.","On 15 May 2017 a female tiger escaped from an exercise enclosure in the rear area of the facility. The tiger was
discovered loose on the premises by an employee during evening feeding. The employee immediately retreated
and called an emergency code on the radio. No park visitors were present due to the late hour. The facility owner
and other employees responded immediately and located the tiger in a corner of the facility near the perimeter
fence. With her proximity to the perimeter fence, and the high danger if she was to escape the facility under cover
of darkness, the licensee made the decision to shoot and kill the animal. This was accomplished with a single
round from a rifle by the licensee.
The facility did not know how the tiger escaped from the pen. The enclosure is a common exercise yard in the
middle of multiple pens, recently built by the facility, and used by numerous animals in rotation. The fencing of the
enclosure meets current requirements for height on three sides. On the fourth side there was a narrow sheet metal
ledge along the inside of the fence. This ledge is actually the border of the metal roof of an adjacent set of pens
which extends through the exercise yard fence. The ledge is approximately a foot wide, and ten feet in height. The
facility has since removed this ledge, and there are no other obvious structural problems with the enclosure.
This was a focused inspection to address this specific incident. The exercise enclosure clearly failed to contain this
tiger. After her escape, the facility did react appropriately according to their emergency protocols. The facility also
immediately contacted their USDA inspector to self-report the incident. As mentioned, the facility removed the
sheet metal ledge following the focused inspection.
The facility must take all necessary steps to ensure the exercise enclosure and all other park enclosures are

unit. When facing forward such as the leopard at time of inspection its flanks touched the back wall of the housing
unit while it had its front legs tucked beside its body and its head stuck out of the front of the housing unit. The width
dimension of the housing unit would not allow for either animal to lie, it was far too narrow.
These units had an overhang on the roof which would have been the appropriate length for the housing unit itself to
provide for the protection and comfort of the animals. The width should be of a similar dimension which would allow
for the animals to lay in either direction comfortably.

met the provisions that a housing unit should. It was long enough and wide enough to provide protection from the
elements and prevent discomfort to the animal. Ventilation for this unit was provided by the entrance to the housing
unit. The animal had sufficient shade provided so that ventilation was not a factor at this time.

enclosure with the three lions were of a size sufficient for one animal only.
When the Director was asked if a housing unit for each animal in the enclosure equivalent to the pad size poured
was to be provided for each animal the answer was no that the pad currently poured was to be the housing unit for
the animals in the enclosure.

would be large enough for all the animals to enter at one time and be provided protection from the elements, could
move about freely, sit, stand and lie in a normal manner the answer was no that they needed to be larger.
These units which are not large enough for all the animals to enter at one time, need to be enlarged or multiple

AV notes do not state whether these observations were made by her or someone else. On 3/26/14 the AV clinical
notes did indicate that she observed the animal in person. According to her notes the (cid:28)eye was open to almost
normal position(cid:29) and (cid:28)there was minimal drainage(cid:29). She also noted the lion (cid:28)appeared weak in the rear and slightly
favored the right rear leg(cid:29). The lion was given 5 cc Pen G but no diagnostics appear to have been done at that time.
From 3/27/14 until 4/5/14 the lion received intermittent Pen G injections. On 4/3/14 the AV noted the licensee
communicated to the AV that the lion was (cid:28)showing strange movements(cid:29).
On 4/5/14 the AV visited the facility and observed the lion. She notes (cid:28)the eye is much improved(cid:29) but he (cid:28)appears
weak and somewhat uncoordinated in the rear(cid:29). The AV noted the licensee (cid:28)decided he did not want further
diagnostics or treatment(cid:29).
The AV also noted (cid:28)we expect his neurologic condition to deteriorate and Tim plans on euthanizing with a gunshot
to the head when Batman(cid:25)s quality of life is no longer adequate(cid:29).
This AV resigned as of the end of April, 2014.
On 5/1/14 a contract with a new AV was entered into by the facility but as of 8/5/14 a formalized plan of veterinary
care by the new AV had not been finalized and signed. The new AV did state that she had read the previous AV(cid:25)s

The licensee is responsible for providing adequate veterinary care from a veterinarian experienced with the species
who can oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care. The current diet outlined in the PVC does not
adequately address the age, species, or condition of the animals being fed at the facility. The poor body condition
of the following animals confirms the inadequacy of the diets:

***** According to clinical notes provided by the attending veterinarian, (cid:28)Batman(cid:29), an 11 year old male lion was
anesthetized on Aug 10, 2014. According to the clinical notes his left eye was examined. This animal has had a
problem with his right eye since March of this year. I suspect the veterinarian meant to write (cid:28)right(cid:29) eye in her
clinical notes. The notes indicate no abnormalities were identified with the affected eye. The AV flushed the eye,
applied topical antibiotic ointment, and recommended monitoring for (cid:28)erythema and color to the discharge(cid:29). The
clinical notes also indicate the AV suspects a clogged nasal lacrimal duct may be the cause for the squinty eye
however she did not have equipment with her to check the nasal lacrimal duct during the anesthesia. Anesthesia in
old, ill, large cats can be difficult and risky for the animals. Because of this difficulty the veterinarian should have
been thoroughly prepared to evaluate all problems with this animal while it was anesthetized.
The clinical notes also state (cid:28)ataxic in rear(cid:29) however there is nothing in the notes or the laboratory tests to indicate
how or if the ataxia was evaluated.
The licensee is required to have an adequate program of veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. As of August 11th this animal continues to
have a squinty eye with the third eyelid protruding across half of the eye. This indicates some type of continued
irritation with the eye and nothing has been done to evaluate the documented ataxia therefore appropriate methods
to diagnose and treat diseases and injuries have not occurred.
The licensee needs to obtain adequate veterinary care for the resident animals.
This was a focused inspection to address the Direct, Repeat NCI regarding Adequate Veterinary Care cited on Aug

records provided by this facility after the Aug 5, 2014 inspection, Batman has had a problem with his right eye since
March 2014. USDA inspectors have observed this animal with varying degrees of eye squinting and third eyelid
prolapse at all 6 inspections that have occurred since July 22, 2014. According to veterinary records an attempt
was made by the current attending veterinarian to evaluate the eye on Aug 10, 2014 but no abnormalities were
found.
Despite repeated requests by USDA officials for documentation on diagnostics and treatments that have occurred
since Aug 10th for this eye problem, adequate veterinary records have not been provided by the Attending
Veterinarian or the facility. An email from the attending veterinarian received on Sept 9, 2014 states (cid:28)Batman hates
the supplement but is receiving it. Ataxia is not evident, eye is still draining. We will try repeating oral antibiotics
since eye did improve on them.(cid:29) This is the only communication received thus far from the Attending Veterinarian.
At the Aug 19th and Sept 23rd inspections USDA officials recommended a veterinary ophthalmologist be consulted
since the current attending veterinarian has been unable to resolve the eye problem. As of the Nov 5th inspection
there have been no documents or records indicating that any further diagnostics or consultations have occurred.

flight SU106 Aeroflot Airlines, originating from China. Airway bill number 55500380816. The LACPH veterinarian
and CDC personnel were present at the Aeroflot cargo area when the dog arrived.
A male intact yellow retriever mix displaying neurological signs arrived to the Aeroflot airline cargo area. CDC
personnel denied entry of this dog as a rabies suspect and a LACPHV issued a health order to the airline for this
dog to be seen at a veterinary clinic for evaluation. According to the LACPHV, they cannot rule out rabies and the
dog needed to be quarantined and observed. The dog’s paperwork included a health certificate and rabies
certificate with no information regarding this dog’s neurologic problems.
LACPHV found a veterinary clinic that would be willing to see the dog and quarantine him. The cargo/ intermediate
handler took the dog to an alternate veterinary hospital, but the clinic could not handle the case at that time. The
dog was returned back to the Aeroflot cargo area without being evaluated. The dog was taken to the Los Angeles
City Shelter the following morning by the cargo/intermediate handler and has since received appropriate veterinary
care.

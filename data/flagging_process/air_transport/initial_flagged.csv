6aca726ab968b0ab,2.31(c),,False,Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).,"In 2024, the facility’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) did not review the facility’s program for the
humane care and use of animals, inspect the animal facilities, or prepare reports of evaluations conducted, at least once
every 6 months as required by the Act and the regulations. The facility completed inspections in December 2023 and
most recently in September 2024. Furthermore, none of the IACUC review/inspection reports have ever been signed by a
majority of the IACUC members and did not include any minority views. The IACUC needs to ensure the semiannual
report is complete and ensure the report is reviewed and signed by a majority of IACUC members in accordance with the
Animal Welfare Act. Additionally, the IACUC must conduct semi-annual reviews and inspections, and submit the signed
evaluation report to the Institutional Official (IO) as notification of the overall status of the facility and any identified
deficiencies to the IO so that the IO can determine that the IACUC is able to ensure the humane care and use of animals,
and any identified issues are addressed in a timely manner. Correct at next semi-annual IACUC review, inspection and
evaluation report.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.

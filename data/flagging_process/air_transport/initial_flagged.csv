a55a59616b716a54,2.36(b)(3),,False,Annual report.,"A review of IACUC approved protocol DB01V found that it included housing calves in enclosures that limit their movement
to laying and standing. Per the facility’s census, calves were used on this protocol during the 2023 Fiscal Year, however
this exception to the AWA standards was not reported with the annual report submitted to USDA Animal Care. To assure
that the facility is adhering to the standards and regulations under the Act, a summary of all IACUC approved exceptions
must be attached to the annual report. Correct by submitting a revised FY 2023 annual report with a summary of all
exceptions including a brief explanation of the exceptions, as well as the species and number of animals affected. Correct

a55a59616b716a54,3.130,,False,Watering.,"On June 12, 2023, study related blood draws were challenging on 6 sheep who were found to be mildly dehydrated. Once
presented with water, the sheep drank eagerly and for a prolonged period. Upon closer examination, the facility found the
water line to the animals’ enclosures to be disconnected. This lapse in water access caused the sheep's thirst and
dehydration. Potable water must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals. The sheep
recovered without needing medical treatment and corrective actions were put in place at the time of inspection.

6aca726ab968b0ab,2.31(c),,False,Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).,"In 2024, the facility’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) did not review the facility’s program for the
humane care and use of animals, inspect the animal facilities, or prepare reports of evaluations conducted, at least once
every 6 months as required by the Act and the regulations. The facility completed inspections in December 2023 and
most recently in September 2024. Furthermore, none of the IACUC review/inspection reports have ever been signed by a
majority of the IACUC members and did not include any minority views. The IACUC needs to ensure the semiannual
report is complete and ensure the report is reviewed and signed by a majority of IACUC members in accordance with the
Animal Welfare Act. Additionally, the IACUC must conduct semi-annual reviews and inspections, and submit the signed
evaluation report to the Institutional Official (IO) as notification of the overall status of the facility and any identified
deficiencies to the IO so that the IO can determine that the IACUC is able to ensure the humane care and use of animals,
and any identified issues are addressed in a timely manner. Correct at next semi-annual IACUC review, inspection and
evaluation report.

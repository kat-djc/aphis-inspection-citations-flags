was accepted for transport was greater than 4 hours before the scheduled departure time. Accepting an animal for
transport greater than four hours before departure time does not ensure that the animal received proper care prior

3911). There is a feeding and watering certification attached to the enclosure. This certification is a pre-printed,
typed label which states ""In the next 24 hour period the animal should be offered water and food at ____ (time) on
_____ (date)."" The date is filled out but the ""time"" is illegible to the inspectors. The supervisor states this is a
signature. There are no specific instructions for feeding and watering this animal within the next 24 hours. This does
not ensure the proper feeding and watering of the animal during transit.
From this day forward, animals must not be accepted for transport unless feeding and watering certifications have
specific instructions for feeding and watering for a 24 hour period.

c6c8e1c67493a032,2.27(a),,False,NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF OPERATION.,"The registrant is operating a cargo office at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) for various airlines that
transport animals. The Swissport personnel frequently receive and handle animals in transit for the carriers that use
this cargo office. Although Swissport North America Inc. is registered with USDA / APHIS / Animal Care as an
intermediate handler, they did not inform Animal Care that SEA should be included as an active site. The SEA site
was cancelled on 9 MAR 2015. Failure to notify Animal Care means that routine inspections cannot be conducted,
which could put animal welfare at risk.
The registrant must immediately notify Animal Care in writing requesting the SEA site be added to their registration.

462fd135ca532dcd,3.13(f),Critical,False,CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.,"The information below was provided to USDA Animal Care from a Los Angeles County Public Health
Veterinarian(LACPHV) concerning an approximately 6-month-old dog that was transported on May 14, 2019, on
flight SU106 Aeroflot Airlines, originating from China. Airway bill number 55500380816. The LACPH veterinarian
and CDC personnel were present at the Aeroflot cargo area when the dog arrived.
A male intact yellow retriever mix displaying neurological signs arrived to the Aeroflot airline cargo area. CDC
personnel denied entry of this dog as a rabies suspect and a LACPHV issued a health order to the airline for this
dog to be seen at a veterinary clinic for evaluation. According to the LACPHV, they cannot rule out rabies and the
dog needed to be quarantined and observed. The dog’s paperwork included a health certificate and rabies
certificate with no information regarding this dog’s neurologic problems.
LACPHV found a veterinary clinic that would be willing to see the dog and quarantine him. The cargo/ intermediate
handler took the dog to an alternate veterinary hospital, but the clinic could not handle the case at that time. The
dog was returned back to the Aeroflot cargo area without being evaluated. The dog was taken to the Los Angeles
City Shelter the following morning by the cargo/intermediate handler and has since received appropriate veterinary
care.
As a registered intermediate (IH), the IH must continue to provide proper care, including veterinary care if needed,
feeding, and housing to any dog and maintain any dog in accordance with generally accepted professional and
husbandry practices while under their care.",1,"Matched positive rules: ['airport_terms', 'transport_terms', 'document_terms']","['airport_terms', 'transport_terms', 'document_terms']",[]

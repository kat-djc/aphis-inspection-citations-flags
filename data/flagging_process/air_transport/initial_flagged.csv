2880f50128bba16e,3.80(a)(1),,False,PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.,"According to facility records, September 1, 2015, personnel discovered a male, cynomolgus monkey outside of his
primary enclosure. The animal was recaptured and evaluated by veterinary staff. He sustained injuries on the third
and fourth digits on his left foot and received immediate veterinary care. At the time of inspection, the animal did not
appear to be in any pain or distress.
Upon being notified of the escape of the monkey, the veterinary staff immediately conducted an investigation. All the
proper procedures had been followed by personnel. It could not be determined exactly how the animal was able to
escape from his enclosure.
As per section 3.80 (a) (2) (iii), primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they contain the
nonhuman primates securely and prevent accidental opening of the enclosure, including opening by the animal.
The research facility acted to address this item by conducting an investigation and implementing appropriate
corrective actions to prevent any future incidents.
The facility self-reported both incidents to USDA.
This inspection was conducted at the West Point, PA site from September 8-11, 2015.
The exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.

enclosure. According to facility documents, an Animal Care Technician identified the injured macaque during routine
husbandry duties. The Animal Care Technician immediately notified the LAR Veterinarian. Due to the nature of the
injures, the macaque was provided veterinary care by the LAR Veterinarian.
At the time of evaluating the incident, facility personnel noted that the chain used to secure the divider separating the
enclosures was no longer in place and the lock used to secure the chain was open. Additionally, further evaluation in the
incident noted that a cage change had been done the day prior. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained
to prevent accidental opening of any part of the enclosure to protect non-human primates from injury.

that this room of macaques did not receive their ration of monkey biscuits the day before and the animals were
immediately fed. The Veterinarian reviewed and observed the rhesus macaques on May 30th and determined that all the
macaques were in good health.
Non-human primates must be fed at least once each day to meet their normal daily nutritional requirements and to
maintain their overall health.

were no longer 12 deer in Pen 2 and the disposition of the deer is unknown. Stray dogs have gained access to the facility
in the past by digging under the perimeter fence. Currently ,there is no method to prevent predators from digging under
the fence or otherwise gaining access to the animal facility. Stray/feral dogs may severely injury or kill deer or cattle . The

At time of the inspection , there are bags of cattle mineral and deer feed stored on a pallet near the edge of the open
sided Tractor Barn. An employee did verify that these supplies were currently being fed to the animals. Several bags of
mineral and deer feed have been torn open by stray dogs and scattered mineral and feed from these bags has spilled on
the floor around the feed. Storing feed in an area open to the weather allows for contamination of the feed by pests and
deterioration by weather. The quality of the feed/mineral can quickly deteriorate once the bag is torn. The spilled feed on
the floor serves as an attractant for pests which may contaminate the feed. Supplies of food must be protected from
contamination/deterioration to ensure feed quality .

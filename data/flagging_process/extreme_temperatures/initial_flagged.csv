zebra as well as the east fence line that makes up the perimeter fence is only five feet in height. The requirement
is that the perimeter fence be six feet in height for non-dangerous type animals such as the camel and zebra. Lack
of a six foot perimeter fence does not work to restrict unwanted animals and unauthorized people from having
access to the animals housed within. It also cannot function as a secondary containment system. The areas of the
perimeter fence that are five feet in height must be corrected to six feet in height. Correct by: November 30, 2014.

animal dispositions) were not available for review at the time of inspection. The unavailability of the required
records does not allow APHIS Officials to determine if the records are accurate and complete, that the program of
veterinary care is being followed to ensure the health of the animals, or for the proper tracking of the animals.
Maintain all required records at the facility so they are available for review at the time of inspection. Correct from
this date forward.
Note-no regulated animals were present at the time of inspection.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.

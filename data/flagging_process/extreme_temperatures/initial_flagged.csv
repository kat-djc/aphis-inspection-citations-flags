practices of feeding and cleaning alone does not demonstrate this. The ability to recognize the required materials
for building enclosures, housing units, enrichment choices, condition of the animals themselves to aid in evaluating
good nutrition, ability to reconize an animal which is not acting as the others which can be an indication of a health
issue so that this can be conveyed to the attending veterinarian are just a few of those that this facility has failed to
show which would demonstrate some of the experience and knowledge which pretains to the species under their
care.
If the facility personnel are not certain of the needs then they should seek out other persons in the same type of
business or similar business such as zoos other individuals who have similar animals. They should be able to
determine the types of materials which would be appropriate or not for use around the animals if they have the
experience and knowledge of the species they are working with.

***** At time of inspection the chain-link fabric used for the enclosure located directly west of the leopard enclosure
consisted of several different sized pieces of chain-link fabric. Where the two eight foot sections where joined
together there were several locations which had not been fastened together they were simply overlapping each
other. There were several places where they were not fastened to the posts used to support the construction, At the
top there was no top rail or tension wire which was securely fastened to the posts for supporting the chain link
fabric.
This was the construction of the south wall of this enclosure. The walls of the rest of the enclosure consisted of
chain-link fabric in various sizes with the use of a tension wire along the top which was not attached to the post
supports and in some locations missing entirely.
***** In the enclosure next to this enclosure to the north it was constructed of chain-link fabric and posts with what
was to be considered a 45 degree kick in of chain-link material along the top. The fabric along the top sagged in
many places from having no top support such as a tension wire or top rail. This fails to provide the type of system

***** At time of inspection the concrete block housing units for both the Leopard and Cougar were to narrow and not
long enough to completely protect the cats from the elements and to prevent discomfort from the elements. The cats
had to lay one of two directions only, facing towards the front or rear of the longest measurement of the housing
unit. When facing forward such as the leopard at time of inspection its flanks touched the back wall of the housing
unit while it had its front legs tucked beside its body and its head stuck out of the front of the housing unit. The width
dimension of the housing unit would not allow for either animal to lie, it was far too narrow.
These units had an overhang on the roof which would have been the appropriate length for the housing unit itself to
provide for the protection and comfort of the animals. The width should be of a similar dimension which would allow
for the animals to lay in either direction comfortably.
***** At time of inspection the single housed male lion had been provided with a concrete block housing unit which
met the provisions that a housing unit should. It was long enough and wide enough to provide protection from the
elements and prevent discomfort to the animal. Ventilation for this unit was provided by the entrance to the housing
unit. The animal had sufficient shade provided so that ventilation was not a factor at this time.
***** At time of inspection the concrete pads that had been poured in the enclosure housing the two tigers and the
enclosure with the three lions were of a size sufficient for one animal only.
When the Director was asked if a housing unit for each animal in the enclosure equivalent to the pad size poured
was to be provided for each animal the answer was no that the pad currently poured was to be the housing unit for
the animals in the enclosure.
After seeing the unit for the single lion the inspector asked the director if the proposed pad size and housing units
would be large enough for all the animals to enter at one time and be provided protection from the elements, could
move about freely, sit, stand and lie in a normal manner the answer was no that they needed to be larger.
These units which are not large enough for all the animals to enter at one time, need to be enlarged or multiple
housing units which can accommodate all animals in the enclosures need to be constructed which will provide
protection of the animals from the elements and prevent discomfort to the animals.

AV clinical notes for a male lion named Batman, which were unavailable until after the inspection of 7/22/14,
indicate that on 3/19 /14 he was observed to have his right third eyelid elevated and the eye half closed and
drainage present. On 3/21/14 it is noted that the third eyelid is even more elevated and the eye more closed. The
AV notes do not state whether these observations were made by her or someone else. On 3/26/14 the AV clinical
notes did indicate that she observed the animal in person. According to her notes the (cid:28)eye was open to almost
normal position(cid:29) and (cid:28)there was minimal drainage(cid:29). She also noted the lion (cid:28)appeared weak in the rear and slightly
favored the right rear leg(cid:29). The lion was given 5 cc Pen G but no diagnostics appear to have been done at that time.
From 3/27/14 until 4/5/14 the lion received intermittent Pen G injections. On 4/3/14 the AV noted the licensee
communicated to the AV that the lion was (cid:28)showing strange movements(cid:29).
On 4/5/14 the AV visited the facility and observed the lion. She notes (cid:28)the eye is much improved(cid:29) but he (cid:28)appears
weak and somewhat uncoordinated in the rear(cid:29). The AV noted the licensee (cid:28)decided he did not want further
diagnostics or treatment(cid:29).
The AV also noted (cid:28)we expect his neurologic condition to deteriorate and Tim plans on euthanizing with a gunshot
to the head when Batman(cid:25)s quality of life is no longer adequate(cid:29).
This AV resigned as of the end of April, 2014.

state (cid:28)lions, tigers, cougars, and leopards are fed 8 (cid:19) 15 lbs. a day.(cid:29) There is a large difference in weight between
healthy adult lions and tigers and healthy adult cougars and leopards. Cougars and leopards fed 8 (cid:19) 15 lbs. of meat
a day are being fed well over 3% of their body weight. Animals receiving this much food should be in better body
condition than the cougar currently at the facility. The PVC states they are currently feeding (cid:28)whole prey diet(cid:29) with
bone but does not explain how they determine the meat on the bones is actually 8 (cid:19) 15 lbs. of meat. The PVC state
(cid:28)Oasis vitamins with extra taurine is given when determined a supplement is necessary(cid:29). They do not explain how
they determine a supplement is needed. The PVC states (cid:28)when whole prey diet is not being utilized we feed a

The licensee is responsible for providing adequate veterinary care from a veterinarian experienced with the species

***** According to clinical notes provided by the attending veterinarian, (cid:28)Batman(cid:29), an 11 year old male lion was
anesthetized on Aug 10, 2014. According to the clinical notes his left eye was examined. This animal has had a
problem with his right eye since March of this year. I suspect the veterinarian meant to write (cid:28)right(cid:29) eye in her
clinical notes. The notes indicate no abnormalities were identified with the affected eye. The AV flushed the eye,
applied topical antibiotic ointment, and recommended monitoring for (cid:28)erythema and color to the discharge(cid:29). The
clinical notes also indicate the AV suspects a clogged nasal lacrimal duct may be the cause for the squinty eye
however she did not have equipment with her to check the nasal lacrimal duct during the anesthesia. Anesthesia in
old, ill, large cats can be difficult and risky for the animals. Because of this difficulty the veterinarian should have
been thoroughly prepared to evaluate all problems with this animal while it was anesthetized.
The clinical notes also state (cid:28)ataxic in rear(cid:29) however there is nothing in the notes or the laboratory tests to indicate
how or if the ataxia was evaluated.
The licensee is required to have an adequate program of veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. As of August 11th this animal continues to
have a squinty eye with the third eyelid protruding across half of the eye. This indicates some type of continued
irritation with the eye and nothing has been done to evaluate the documented ataxia therefore appropriate methods
to diagnose and treat diseases and injuries have not occurred.
The licensee needs to obtain adequate veterinary care for the resident animals.

flies in front of the freezer can contaminate meat being loaded and unloaded from the freezer.
The licensee needs to develop a protocol for adequately preparing and freezing food. All parts of the carcass
should be protected from freezer burn. The carcasses should be separated into small segments and thoroughly
frozen before being stacked. Shelves in the freezer would allow for adequate separation and freezing of smaller

***** The licensee retained a new attending veterinarian in May 2014. By the veterinarians own admission, she
does not have experience with large exotic cats. The animals at this facility range from middle age to geriatric and
have had minimal veterinary care over the past several years. During the Aug 19, 2014 inspection USDA officials
directed the facility to obtain a veterinarian with large exotic felid experience or a consultant to work with the current
attending veterinarian to ensure these animals receive adequate care specific for the species. As of the Nov 5th
inspection a written document confirming they have retained a consultant under formal arrangements to work with
the current attending veterinarian has not been provided.
As of the Nov 5th inspection the minimal treatment provided by the current attending veterinarian is concerning.
The only documents of veterinary care provided by the attending veterinarian were laboratory results for fecal
exams done on all of the large cats. Those documents showed Sampson (19 year old tiger) and Boudreau (19 year
old cougar) were positive for the intestinal parasite Spirometra. There are short email statements received on Sept
29, 2014 from the attending veterinarian that had been sent to the facility director and forwarded by the Director to
APHIS officials stating she prescribed Panacur 10 mg/kg for 3 days for treatment of the Spirometra. Panacur is not
considered an effective treatment for Spirometra. Moses, the 8 year old lion, was positive for fluke ova. There is a
short email statement received on Sept 29, 2014 from the attending veterinarian stating she prescribed Panacur 10
mg/kg for 3 days. Panacur at this dose is not an effective treatment for intestinal flukes. Documents have not been
provided indicating follow up fecal exams have been done to confirm effectiveness of treatment. The above does

***** ***** Batman is a 12 year old male lion with an ongoing problem with his right eye. According to the few health
records provided by this facility after the Aug 5, 2014 inspection, Batman has had a problem with his right eye since
March 2014. USDA inspectors have observed this animal with varying degrees of eye squinting and third eyelid
prolapse at all 6 inspections that have occurred since July 22, 2014. According to veterinary records an attempt
was made by the current attending veterinarian to evaluate the eye on Aug 10, 2014 but no abnormalities were
found.
Despite repeated requests by USDA officials for documentation on diagnostics and treatments that have occurred
since Aug 10th for this eye problem, adequate veterinary records have not been provided by the Attending
Veterinarian or the facility. An email from the attending veterinarian received on Sept 9, 2014 states (cid:28)Batman hates
the supplement but is receiving it. Ataxia is not evident, eye is still draining. We will try repeating oral antibiotics
since eye did improve on them.(cid:29) This is the only communication received thus far from the Attending Veterinarian.
At the Aug 19th and Sept 23rd inspections USDA officials recommended a veterinary ophthalmologist be consulted
since the current attending veterinarian has been unable to resolve the eye problem. As of the Nov 5th inspection
there have been no documents or records indicating that any further diagnostics or consultations have occurred.
Appropriate means of diagnosis, treatment and control of this ocular disease or injury does not appear to have
taken place given the chronic 8 month duration of the problem and there has been no resolution for the animal.
Batman has had to suffer with an eye problem for 8 months. Eye issues can be extremely painful and distressful.

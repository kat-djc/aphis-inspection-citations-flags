None of the transport enclosures housing the dogs and cats had adequate projecting rims on the front and back panels,
which provided the majority of ventilation. The frame surrounding the wire panels for ventilation on the front door and back
of the enclosures only provided a projecting rim between 0.25 inch and 0.5 inch from the wire screen. There were no
additional projecting rims on the front and back of the enclosures.
Insufficient projecting rims do not prevent obstruction of ventilation openings and can lead to decreased ventilation and air
circulation space between the primary enclosure and anything it is placed against. All primary enclosures transporting
animals that are not permanently affixed to the conveyance must have projecting rims or similar devices on the exterior of
each enclosure wall having a ventilation opening to prevent obstruction of the openings and be at least 0.75 inches (1.9

Proper labeling of transport enclosures is important to ensure enclosures are readily identified as containing live animals
as well as the intended orientation of the enclosure to assist first responders or others that may need to know animals are
present and/or respond to their aid in an emergency. The facility must ensure that transport enclosures are clearly marked
on top and on one or more sides with the words ""Live Animals,"" in letters at least one inch high, and with arrows or other
markings to indicate the correct upright position of the primary enclosure to ensure the safety of the animals during
transport.

Projecting rims on transport enclosures are important to ensure ventilated areas of the enclosure walls are not blocked by
other transport crates or items in the vehicle during transport; blockage of ventilation during transport can cause
discomfort, illness or even death to animals. The facility must ensure that all transport enclosures have projecting rims or
similar devices large enough to provide a minimum air circulation space of 0.75 inches between the primary enclosure
and anything the enclosure is adjacent to, in order to help keep the animals safe during transport.

health, without veterinary consult or intervention. On 08/04/2024, husbandry staff made an entry in an observation log for
a female adult budgie that appeared unable to fly. The bird was removed from the flock and placed in a separate room for
quarantine and continued observation. The following day, on 08/05/2024, husbandry staff made another log entry stating
that the bird was ""lethargic."" On 08/06/2024, two separate logs document that the bird was found deceased. The
attending veterinarian was not notified at any time during this three-day period regarding the bird's condition.
Failure to promptly report health or behavioral issues to the attending veterinarian resulted in delayed veterinary
intervention that could have stopped the progression of the bird's decline and avoided prolonged discomfort or suffering
the animal may have experienced in the days between when the problem was first noticed and when the bird died. Daily
observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being must be performed, and a mechanism of direct and

from a gate. This occurred while workers were bringing a large load of hay inside the enclosure while the young wallaby
was allowed free roam of the entire area. Video footage of the area shows the wallaby sustained its lethal injury when it
placed its head inside a gap on the hinge side of the open primary enclosure gate, and the gate closed while the animal's
head was in the gap. Staff realized the injury immediately afterward and contacted the attending veterinarian, but the
animal died from its injury in only a few minutes. Following this incident, the facility installed a guard covering to prevent
future entrapment of animals during gate operation.
Bennett's wallabies are a marsupial species that normally remain in the pouch of their dam until nine months of age, after
which they remain unweaned, cared for and nursed by the dam and in her protective pouch intermittently for several more
months. Allowing this young animal to roam the large enclosure while staff were distracted and unable to view the whole
area while moving the large load inside presented a higher risk of injury to the animal. The licensee must ensure that
handling of all animals is done as expeditiously and as carefully as possible, in a manner that does not cause trauma,
overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort.

was brought to her attention by the inspector during this inspection. Facility staff stated that both animals were
intentionally separated from their dams at an early age to be hand-reared at the facility.
Failure to provide the milk replacement formula that most closely matches that which these growing animals would
consume while nursing from their mothers at their current life stage can result in nutrient deficiencies, inappropriate
development, weakened immune systems and illness. The facility must ensure that food fed to all animals is wholesome,
palatable, free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain the animals in good health.

the injured bird overnight in another room, where it was found deceased the following morning.
Delaying veterinary care to injured animals prolongs their discomfort and suffering, and can result in worsening of an
animal's condition or even death. Every dealer or exhibitor must establish, maintain and follow a program of adequate
veterinary care that includes the provision of emergency, weekend and holiday care for animals when needed.

Seattle, WA with the two dogs so he could pick up a smaller dog on 14March2024, that was to be transported to Alabama.
All three dogs left Seattle, WA around 2 pm on 14March2024 with the transporter.
The transporter stated that the two golden retrievers ate very little during the three days of transport, but the dogs
continued to drink. The transported also reported that he contacted the owner on the morning of 17March 2024 while still
in Georgia, that Bubble and Snow did not want to eat today, and that both were drinking very little. During the inspection
of 9May2024, the transporter stated that Bubble started vomiting shortly after entering Florida on 17March2024. Before
delivering the two dogs to the owner in Kissimmee, FL, the transporter notified the owner that Bubble had died. The dog’s
owner requested that both Bubble and Snow be transported immediately to Urgent Care in Kissimmee, FL. Snow arrived
at Urgent Care around 4 pm on 17March2024, with Bubble already deceased. Snow arrived at Urgent Care with a

rabbits (10), horses (3), guinea Pigs (25), goats (28), ducks (10), and chickens (25). Exhibiting a combination of these
species in these numbers is an activity that required a license under the AWA.
The facility previously had a courtesy visit from an USDA inspector on August 9,2023 and was informed at that time of the
requirements for needing a USDA license under the AWA. An application for licensure was received by USDA APHIS
Animal Care on February 21,2024. In preparation for licensing, a pre-license phone call on March 15, 2024 was
conducted with the applicant, during which requirements for licensing and compliance with the AWA were reviewed. The
applicant did not move forward with the application process by contacting the inspector to schedule the pre-license
inspections as is required for licensure and is still conducting regulated activity without a license.
Conducting regulated activity without a USDA license does not comply with the Animal Welfare Act or ensure that APHIS

A public complaint was received by the USDA on October 21, 2024, which reported budgerigar deaths and animal welfare
concerns observed at the facility during a pumpkin patch event held at the facility on October 20, 2024. A USDA inspector
visit to the facility on November 19, 2024, confirmed budgerigars were on public display at the facility and that customers
were encouraged to enter the budgerigar enclosure to feed and interact with the birds. The owner stated that she was not
aware of any deaths or customer complaints related to events held at the facility on October 20. An accurate count of
budgerigars in the enclosure was not possible at the time of the USDA visit on November 19, due to the flight activity of
the large number of birds held within the enclose. The owner reported there were 200 budgerigars within the enclosure at

minutes later the dog had expired. The AV was notified of the adverse event and conducted an investigation. It
was determined that the pre-procedural respiratory rate of the dog was elevated above normal but research staff did
not notify veterinary services of the problem and administered general anesthesia to the dog. Once the dog was

rabbits lifted their heads, tried to move but their feet slid on the floor of the cage and they could not become upright.
The lateral recumbent rabbit was able to get into sternal recumbency.
It was determined during a review of the animals’ medical records that that the 3 rabbits had undergone an IACUC
approved procedure involving the administration of injectable anesthesia at approximately 10:10 AM that morning.
Notations in the records made by research personnel indicated that the animals had recovered approximately 1 ½
hrs after the anesthesia was administered and were returned to their enclosures. The condition of the 3 rabbits and

as possible to minimize discomfort, pain, or distress. Animals recovering from anesthesia need to be observed until
fully recovered. These guidelines are important to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.

ensure that personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform their duties.
In response to this incident, the facility immediately conducted additional training on anesthetic machine use and
there have been no additional related incidents. Corrected prior to inspection.
This inspection was conducted from 10/15 - 10/16/18. An initial exit interview was conducted on site on 10/16/18. A

4c4ac5018bf80d82,2.38(f)(1),Critical,False,MISCELLANEOUS.,"On 3/8/19, a rabbit was placed in a restraint device on top of a counter prior to the induction of anesthesia. During
induction, the rabbit escaped from the restraint device onto the counter and ended up in the sink that was set into
the counter. Research staff re-restrained the rabbit and proceeded with induction of anesthesia. During anesthetic
recovery, the animal vocalized and attempted to right itself from recumbency. Veterinary staff was immediately
contacted to assess the animal. On examination, a spinal fracture was identified and the animal was humanely
euthanized. Veterinary staff determined that the fracture occurred between pre-anesthetic assessment of the animal
and its recovery from anesthesia. Inspection of the restraint device by facility personnel revealed a damaged latch
that prevented secure closure of the device. The damaged restraint device did not allow for safe handling of the
animal. Per this section of the regulations, handling shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not
cause trauma or physical harm.
This item has been corrected, as the facility has inspected all restraint devices and replaced them as necessary.
This event was self-reported to the USDA.
This inspection was conducted from 4/8/19 - 4/9/19. This exit briefing was conducted on site with facility personnel

fab7a8970bec0130,2.33(b)(3),Critical,False,Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.,"In April 2021, a rabbit on study was found entrapped in an e-collar. Review of the incident revealed that the animal had
been observed by research staff that morning. The animal was recorded as “healthy” at the time of that observation, but it
was discovered 1 hour and 22 minutes later entrapped in the collar and in distress. The attending veterinarian was
notified.
The entrapment had resulted in a laceration and swelling of the muzzle of the animal, causing narrowing of the animal's
airway leading to respiratory distress. On exam, the animal was cyanotic and had lost 27% of its body weight. Facility
representatives note that the extent of the injury and the weight loss was such that it was unlikely to have occurred in the
82 minutes between clinical observation by designated research staff and observation of the animal in distress by the
veterinary staff. Accurate information about the condition of the animal at the time of the initial observation was not
recorded or conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
Daily observation of animals to assess their health and well-being may be conducted by someone other than the
attending veterinarian provided that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health is conveyed to the
attending veterinarian.

***A goat housed in an outdoor enclosure was walking on his front knees (carpal joints). The goat was either unwilling or
unable to rise to walk on his front toes. The licensee was not aware of the condition until the time of inspection and had
not sought treatment for this condition. Failure to identify conditions causing lameness or an abnormal gait and to seek

and the pelvic bone were readily apparent. The goat also had a rough (or unkempt) looking hair coat. The licensee had
not identified the thin condition of this goat or sought treatment for this condition. Poor body condition can indicate a lack
of sufficient quality or quantity food or may indicate other underlying disease processes. Failure to properly observe
and/or communicate animals in poor condition to the attending veterinarian can lead to worsening of the condition,
prolonged unnecessary suffering, and possibly starvation and death.
***Three goats died between 7/15/24 and 7/19/24. The goats were 3-5 years of age. The licensee did not seek veterinary
care for these goats prior to their death and did not consult with the veterinarian about the cause of their death to
determine if other goats at the facility might be at risk of becoming ill or dying. As noted with these goats, failure to identify
disease conditions and seek veterinary care for those conditions has resulted in needless pain and/or suffering for the

At time of the inspection , there are bags of cattle mineral and deer feed stored on a pallet near the edge of the open
sided Tractor Barn. An employee did verify that these supplies were currently being fed to the animals. Several bags of
mineral and deer feed have been torn open by stray dogs and scattered mineral and feed from these bags has spilled on
the floor around the feed. Storing feed in an area open to the weather allows for contamination of the feed by pests and
deterioration by weather. The quality of the feed/mineral can quickly deteriorate once the bag is torn. The spilled feed on
the floor serves as an attractant for pests which may contaminate the feed. Supplies of food must be protected from
contamination/deterioration to ensure feed quality .

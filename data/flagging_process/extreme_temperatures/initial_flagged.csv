a55a59616b716a54,3.130,,False,Watering.,"On June 12, 2023, study related blood draws were challenging on 6 sheep who were found to be mildly dehydrated. Once
presented with water, the sheep drank eagerly and for a prolonged period. Upon closer examination, the facility found the
water line to the animalsâ€™ enclosures to be disconnected. This lapse in water access caused the sheep's thirst and
dehydration. Potable water must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals. The sheep
recovered without needing medical treatment and corrective actions were put in place at the time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.

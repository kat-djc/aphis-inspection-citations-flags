a55a59616b716a54,2.36(b)(3),,False,Annual report.,"A review of IACUC approved protocol DB01V found that it included housing calves in enclosures that limit their movement
to laying and standing. Per the facility’s census, calves were used on this protocol during the 2023 Fiscal Year, however
this exception to the AWA standards was not reported with the annual report submitted to USDA Animal Care. To assure
that the facility is adhering to the standards and regulations under the Act, a summary of all IACUC approved exceptions
must be attached to the annual report. Correct by submitting a revised FY 2023 annual report with a summary of all
exceptions including a brief explanation of the exceptions, as well as the species and number of animals affected. Correct
by April 19, 2024."
a55a59616b716a54,3.130,,False,Watering.,"On June 12, 2023, study related blood draws were challenging on 6 sheep who were found to be mildly dehydrated. Once
presented with water, the sheep drank eagerly and for a prolonged period. Upon closer examination, the facility found the
water line to the animals’ enclosures to be disconnected. This lapse in water access caused the sheep's thirst and
dehydration. Potable water must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals. The sheep
recovered without needing medical treatment and corrective actions were put in place at the time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.

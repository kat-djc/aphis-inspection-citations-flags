operating procedure, but the approved animal care and use protocol the animals were enrolled on did not include skin
biopsy procedures or a search for alternatives to the procedure. All research activities involving animals must be reviewed
and approved by the IACUC before being conducted. The facility must ensure that only procedures included on an
approved animal care and use protocol are performed.
The facility corrected this deficiency immediately following the inspection as reported to the inspector on May 29,204.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.

require this rationale in order to prevent the unnecessary use of a species in research. The IACUC must ensure all
principle investigators provide a rationale for the appropriateness of the species used.

a55a59616b716a54,2.36(b)(3),,False,Annual report.,"A review of IACUC approved protocol DB01V found that it included housing calves in enclosures that limit their movement
to laying and standing. Per the facility’s census, calves were used on this protocol during the 2023 Fiscal Year, however
this exception to the AWA standards was not reported with the annual report submitted to USDA Animal Care. To assure
that the facility is adhering to the standards and regulations under the Act, a summary of all IACUC approved exceptions
must be attached to the annual report. Correct by submitting a revised FY 2023 annual report with a summary of all
exceptions including a brief explanation of the exceptions, as well as the species and number of animals affected. Correct
by April 19, 2024."
a55a59616b716a54,3.130,,False,Watering.,"On June 12, 2023, study related blood draws were challenging on 6 sheep who were found to be mildly dehydrated. Once
presented with water, the sheep drank eagerly and for a prolonged period. Upon closer examination, the facility found the
water line to the animals’ enclosures to be disconnected. This lapse in water access caused the sheep's thirst and
dehydration. Potable water must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals. The sheep
recovered without needing medical treatment and corrective actions were put in place at the time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.

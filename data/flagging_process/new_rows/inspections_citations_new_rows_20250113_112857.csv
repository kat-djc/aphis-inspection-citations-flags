*The following housekeeping issues were identified in rabbit housing areas. There was a rabbit restraining device
ready for use that had dried fecal material on its surface; there were several spots of dried blood on the shelf of a
metal cart and on a blood tube holder; the Elizabethan collars of 3 rabbits had fecal material wedged between the
edges of the collar at the closure snaps; and there was dried blood inside the autoclave sterilization pouch that was
being used to store syringes filled with saline.
Per this Section of the Regulations, premises shall be kept clean in order to facilitate prescribed husbandry
practices. The presence of dried fecal material and or blood on equipment does not constitute good housekeeping

on rabbit caging was provided to personnel. Three days after the training was conducted, two more rabbits
escaped. No additional corrective action was taken at that time. From August to September 2018, six additional
rabbits escaped from their enclosures. These incidents were all reported to the IACUC by facility personnel. No
further action has been taken.
The enclosures at this facility are elevated off the floor on a rack system, and there is a substantial risk of injury to
the rabbits upon escape from these enclosures. These incidents are recurrent despite the additional training
provided by the facility in April. Further investigation of the underlying cause of the escapes is warranted to protect
the animals from potential injury. It is the function of the IACUC to review and investigate reported concerns

ce4958e333fb7106,2.32(a),Critical,False,PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.,"On August 24, 2018, an animal was anesthetized for a study procedure. Two research associates were present to
administer and monitor anesthesia. One was a senior employee who was training a junior employee in anesthetic
procedures. The junior employee was responsible for pressure checking the anesthesia machine prior to the
procedure.
The animal was intubated and its vitals were recorded. Eight minutes later, the animal's heart rate was noted to
decline rapidly. The machine was checked and it was discovered that the pop-off valve had remained closed after
the initial pressure check, leading to breathing complications. The veterinarian was immediately notified and
resuscitation was attempted but was unsuccessful.
The anesthetic complications and subsequent death of the animal were the result of failure of personnel to correctly
configure the anesthetic machine after the initial pressure check. It is the responsibility of the research facility to
ensure that personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform their duties.
In response to this incident, the facility immediately conducted additional training on anesthetic machine use and
there have been no additional related incidents. Corrected prior to inspection.

induction, the rabbit escaped from the restraint device onto the counter and ended up in the sink that was set into
the counter. Research staff re-restrained the rabbit and proceeded with induction of anesthesia. During anesthetic
recovery, the animal vocalized and attempted to right itself from recumbency. Veterinary staff was immediately
contacted to assess the animal. On examination, a spinal fracture was identified and the animal was humanely
euthanized. Veterinary staff determined that the fracture occurred between pre-anesthetic assessment of the animal
and its recovery from anesthesia. Inspection of the restraint device by facility personnel revealed a damaged latch
that prevented secure closure of the device. The damaged restraint device did not allow for safe handling of the
animal. Per this section of the regulations, handling shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not
cause trauma or physical harm.

been observed by research staff that morning. The animal was recorded as “healthy” at the time of that observation, but it
was discovered 1 hour and 22 minutes later entrapped in the collar and in distress. The attending veterinarian was
notified.
The entrapment had resulted in a laceration and swelling of the muzzle of the animal, causing narrowing of the animal's
airway leading to respiratory distress. On exam, the animal was cyanotic and had lost 27% of its body weight. Facility
representatives note that the extent of the injury and the weight loss was such that it was unlikely to have occurred in the
82 minutes between clinical observation by designated research staff and observation of the animal in distress by the
veterinary staff. Accurate information about the condition of the animal at the time of the initial observation was not
recorded or conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
Daily observation of animals to assess their health and well-being may be conducted by someone other than the

died within five days of each other of unknown cause and without receiving veterinary care. Additional details are as
follows:
***A goat housed in an outdoor enclosure was walking on his front knees (carpal joints). The goat was either unwilling or
unable to rise to walk on his front toes. The licensee was not aware of the condition until the time of inspection and had
not sought treatment for this condition. Failure to identify conditions causing lameness or an abnormal gait and to seek
treatment for such conditions can lead to unnecessary suffering and further injury.
***A second goat, housed in the same outdoor enclosure as the goat described above, was in very thin body condition.
Even though the goat had a moderately long hair coat (about 1 inch in length), the top of the spine, the shoulder blades,
and the pelvic bone were readily apparent. The goat also had a rough (or unkempt) looking hair coat. The licensee had
not identified the thin condition of this goat or sought treatment for this condition. Poor body condition can indicate a lack
of sufficient quality or quantity food or may indicate other underlying disease processes. Failure to properly observe
and/or communicate animals in poor condition to the attending veterinarian can lead to worsening of the condition,
prolonged unnecessary suffering, and possibly starvation and death.
***Three goats died between 7/15/24 and 7/19/24. The goats were 3-5 years of age. The licensee did not seek veterinary
care for these goats prior to their death and did not consult with the veterinarian about the cause of their death to
determine if other goats at the facility might be at risk of becoming ill or dying. As noted with these goats, failure to identify
disease conditions and seek veterinary care for those conditions has resulted in needless pain and/or suffering for the

After the transfer to the holding protocol both NHPs were used by the Principal Investigator (PI) on the imaging study
protocol. On 03-Aug-2022 the PI was asked by the LAR veterinary associate to stop using NHP A under the imaging
Protocol after it was used two times. This non-compliance was recognized again by the LAR veterinary associate on 08-
Nov-2022 with another NPH (NPH B). This non-compliance was recognized again by the LAR veterinary associate on
08-Nov-2022, as the PI had also used NPH B two times under the imaging protocol after it had been transferred to a
holding protocol.
Proposed activities and proposed significant changes in ongoing activities that have been approved by the IACUC may be

At time of the inspection , there are bags of cattle mineral and deer feed stored on a pallet near the edge of the open
sided Tractor Barn. An employee did verify that these supplies were currently being fed to the animals. Several bags of
mineral and deer feed have been torn open by stray dogs and scattered mineral and feed from these bags has spilled on
the floor around the feed. Storing feed in an area open to the weather allows for contamination of the feed by pests and
deterioration by weather. The quality of the feed/mineral can quickly deteriorate once the bag is torn. The spilled feed on
the floor serves as an attractant for pests which may contaminate the feed. Supplies of food must be protected from
contamination/deterioration to ensure feed quality .

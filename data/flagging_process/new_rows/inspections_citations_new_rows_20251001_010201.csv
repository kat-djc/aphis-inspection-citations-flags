7d1062d6edb90ede,2.131,,True,HANDLING OF ANIMALS.,"(a)
*****Adequate experience and knowledge of the species maintained by a facility is required.
The general husbandry practices of feeding and cleaning alone does not demonstrate this skill. The ability to
recognize the proper required materials for building enclosures, housing units and enrichment choices is lacking.
The lack of ability to recognize the condition of the animals themselves to aid in evaluating good nutrition and the
lack of ability to recognize an animal which is acting abnormally (which can be an indication of a health issue) so
that this can be conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner are further examples of this facility(cid:25)s
failure to exhibit that they possess adequate experience and knowledge of the species under their care.
If the facility personnel are not certain of the needs of the regulated species then they should seek out other
persons in the same type of business or similar business such as zoos other individuals who have similar animals.
They should be able to determine the types of building materials and enrichment items which would be appropriate
or not for use around the animals if they have the appropriate experience and knowledge of the species they are
working with.
This facility currently lacks a person of experience and knowledge of the regulated species and needs to incorporate
into the facility a plan for gaining this help from a person that possesses this experience and knowledge on a routine
basis or that can help to educate those personnel at the facility."

***** At time of inspection the concrete block housing unit for the leopard continues to remain too small to provide
adequate protection and to prevent discomfort from the elements for this animal. Guidance for this facility in an
inspection report dated 7/22/14 regarding this housing unit has been ignored.
A similar housing unit had been constructed for the cougar which was also not large enough to prevent protection
and discomfort from the elements. A new housing unit for the cougar had been constructed and was present during
the inspection of 9/23/14 which provided all the requirements for this animal to be protected and provide for its
comfort during periods of inclement weather. This was discussed with the Director of the facility during the
inspection as being the type of housing unit needed for the leopard as well, this guidance has been ignored as well.

offered food and water during transport, or at any time as needed, according to the consignor's instructions, or in

flight SU106 Aeroflot Airlines, originating from China. Airway bill number 55500380816. The LACPH veterinarian
and CDC personnel were present at the Aeroflot cargo area when the dog arrived.
A male intact yellow retriever mix displaying neurological signs arrived to the Aeroflot airline cargo area. CDC
personnel denied entry of this dog as a rabies suspect and a LACPHV issued a health order to the airline for this
dog to be seen at a veterinary clinic for evaluation. According to the LACPHV, they cannot rule out rabies and the
dog needed to be quarantined and observed. The dog’s paperwork included a health certificate and rabies
certificate with no information regarding this dog’s neurologic problems.
LACPHV found a veterinary clinic that would be willing to see the dog and quarantine him. The cargo/ intermediate
handler took the dog to an alternate veterinary hospital, but the clinic could not handle the case at that time. The
dog was returned back to the Aeroflot cargo area without being evaluated. The dog was taken to the Los Angeles
City Shelter the following morning by the cargo/intermediate handler and has since received appropriate veterinary
care.

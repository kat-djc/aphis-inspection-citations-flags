After the transfer to the holding protocol both NHPs were used by the Principal Investigator (PI) on the imaging study
protocol. On 03-Aug-2022 the PI was asked by the LAR veterinary associate to stop using NHP A under the imaging
Protocol after it was used two times. This non-compliance was recognized again by the LAR veterinary associate on 08-
Nov-2022 with another NPH (NPH B). This non-compliance was recognized again by the LAR veterinary associate on
08-Nov-2022, as the PI had also used NPH B two times under the imaging protocol after it had been transferred to a
holding protocol.
Proposed activities and proposed significant changes in ongoing activities that have been approved by the IACUC may be

At time of the inspection , there are bags of cattle mineral and deer feed stored on a pallet near the edge of the open
sided Tractor Barn. An employee did verify that these supplies were currently being fed to the animals. Several bags of
mineral and deer feed have been torn open by stray dogs and scattered mineral and feed from these bags has spilled on
the floor around the feed. Storing feed in an area open to the weather allows for contamination of the feed by pests and
deterioration by weather. The quality of the feed/mineral can quickly deteriorate once the bag is torn. The spilled feed on
the floor serves as an attractant for pests which may contaminate the feed. Supplies of food must be protected from
contamination/deterioration to ensure feed quality .
